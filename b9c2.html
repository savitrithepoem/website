So when on earth they lived <br /> She had felt him straying through the glades, the glades <br /> A scene in her, its clefts her being's vistas <br /> Opening their secrets to his search and joy, <br /> Because to jealous sweetness in her heart <br /> Whatever happy space his cherished feet <br /> Preferred, must be at once her soul embracing <br /> His body, passioning dumbly to his tread. <br /> But now a silent gulf between them came <br /> And to abysmal loneliness she fell, <br /> Even from herself cast out, from love remote. <br /> Long hours, since long it seems when sluggish time <br /> Is measured by the throbs of the soul's pain, <br /> In an unreal darkness empty and drear <br /> She travelled treading on the corpse of life, <br /> Lost in a blindness of extinguished souls. <br /> Solitary in the anguish of the void <br /> She lived in spite of death, she conquered still; <br /> In vain her puissant being was oppressed: <br /> Her heavy long monotony of pain <br /> Tardily of its fierce self-torture tired. <br /> At first a faint inextinguishable gleam, <br /></td>

<td class="td_poem_text" colspan="3"><br /> I am a timeless Nothingness carrying all, <br /> I am the Illimitable, the mute Alone. <br /> I, Death, am He; there is no other God. <br /> All from my depths are born, they live by death; <br /> All to my depths return and are no more. <br /> I have made a world by my inconscient Force. <br /> My Force is Nature that creates and slays <br /> The hearts that hope, the limbs that long to live. <br /> I have made man her instrument and slave, <br /> His body I made my banquet, his life my food. <br /> Man has no other help but only Death; <br /> He comes to me at his end for rest and peace. <br /> I, Death, am the one refuge of thy soul. <br /> The Gods to whom man prays can help not man; <br /> They are my imaginations and my moods <br /> Reflected in him by illusion's power. <br /> That which thou seest as thy immortal self <br /> Is a shadowy icon of my infinite, <br /> Is Death in thee dreaming of eternity. <br /> I am the Immobile in which all things move, <br /> I am the nude Inane in which they cease: <br /> I have no body and no tongue to speak, <br /> I commune not with human eye and ear; <br /> Only thy thought gave a figure to my void. <br /> Because, O aspirant to divinity, <br /> Thou calledst me to wrestle with thy soul, <br /> I have assumed a face, a form, a voice. <br /> But if there were a Being witnessing all, <br /> How should he help thy passionate desire? <br /> Aloof he watches sole and absolute, <br /> Indifferent to thy cry in nameless calm. <br /> His being is pure, unwounded, motionless, one. <br /> One endless watches the inconscient scene <br /> Where all things perish, as the foam the stars. <br /> The One lives for ever. There no Satyavan <br /> Changing was born and there no Savitri <br /></td>

There love <br /> Came never with his fretful eyes of tears, <br /> Nor Time is there nor the vain vasts of Space. <br /> It wears no living face, it has no name, <br /> No gaze, no heart that throbs; it asks no second <br /> To aid its being or to share its joys. <br /> It is delight immortally alone. <br /> If thou desirest immortality, <br /> Be then alone sufficient to thy soul: <br /> Live in thyself; forget the man thou lov'st. <br /> My last grand death shall rescue thee from life; <br /> Then shalt thou rise into thy unmoved source." <br /> But Savitri replied to the dread Voice: <br /> "O Death, who reasonest, I reason not, <br /> Reason that scans and breaks, but cannot build <br /> Or builds in vain because she doubts her work. <br /> I am, I love, I see, I act, I will." <br /> Death answered her, one deep surrounding cry: <br /> "Know also. Knowing, thou shalt cease to love <br /> And cease to will, delivered from thy heart. <br /> So shalt thou rest for ever and be still, <br /> Consenting to the impermanence of things." <br /> But Savitri replied for man to Death: <br /> "When I have loved for ever, I shall know. <br /> Love in me knows the truth all changings mask. <br /> I know that knowledge is a vast embrace: <br /> I know that every being is myself, <br /> In every heart is hidden the myriad One. <br /> I know the calm Transcendent bears the world, <br /> The veiled Inhabitant, the silent Lord: <br /> I feel his secret act, his intimate fire; <br /> I hear the murmur of the cosmic Voice. <br /> I know my coming was a wave from God. <br /> For all his suns were conscient in my birth, <br /> And one who loves in us came veiled by death. <br /> Then was man born among the monstrous stars <br /></td>
