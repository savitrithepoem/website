Obviously, the Overmind and aesthetics cannot be equated together. Aesthetics is concerned  mainly with
beauty, but more generally with rasa, the response of the mind, the vital  feeling and the sense to a
certain "taste" in things which often may be but is not  necessarily a spiritual feeling. Aesthetics
belongs to the mental range and all that  depends upon it; it may degenerate into aestheticism or may
exaggerate or narrow itself  into some version of the theory of "Art for Art's sake". The Overmind is
essentially a  spiritual power. Mind in it surpasses its ordinary self and rises and takes its stand on
a spiritual foundation. It embraces beauty and sublimates it; it has an essential aesthesis  which is not
limited by rules and canons; it sees a universal and an eternal beauty while it  takes up and transforms
all that is limited and particular. It is besides concerned with things  other than beauty or aesthetics.
It is concerned especially with truth and knowledge or rather  with a wisdom that exceeds what we call
knowledge; its truth goes beyond truth of fact and truth  of thought, even the higher thought which is the
first spiritual range of the thinker. It has the  truth of spiritual thought, spiritual feeling, spiritual
sense and at its highest the truth that  comes by the most intimate spiritual touch or by identity.
Ultimately, truth and beauty come  together and coincide, but in between there is a difference. Overmind in
all its dealings puts  truth first; it brings out the essential truth (and truths) in things and also its
infinite  possibilities; it brings out even the truth that lies behind falsehood and error; it brings
out the truth of the Inconscient and the truth of the Superconscient and all that lies in  between. When
it speaks through poetry, this remains its first essential quality; a limited  aesthetical artistic aim
is not its purpose. It can take up and uplift any or every style  or at least put some stamp of itself upon
it. More or less all that we have called Overhead  poetry has something of this character whether it be from
the Overmind or simply intuitive,  illumined or strong with the strength of the higher revealing Thought;
even when it is not  intrinsically Overhead poetry, still some touch can come in. Even Overhead poetry
itself  does not always deal in what is new or striking or strange; it can take up the obvious,  the common,
the bare and even the bald, the old, even that which without it would seem  stale and hackneyed and raise
it to greatness. Take the lines:

And as a dying man to dying men.<sup>1</sup> </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
The writer is not a poet, not even a conspicuously talented versifier. The statement of the thought  is
bare and direct and the rhetorical device used is of the simplest, but the Overhead touch  somehow got in
through a passionate emotion and sincerity and is unmistakable. In all poetry  a poetical aesthesis of some
kind there must be in the writer and the recipient; but aesthetics  is of many kinds and the ordinary kind
is not sufficient for appreciating the Overhead element  in poetry. A fundamental and universal aesthesis is
needed, something also more intense that  listens, sees and feels from deep within and answers to what is
behind the surface. A greater,  wider and deeper aesthesis then which can answer even to the transcendent
and feel too whatever  of the transcendent or spiritual enters into the things of life, mind and sense.
<br /><br />
The business of the critical intellect is to appreciate and judge and here too it must judge;  but it can
judge and appreciate rightly here only if it first learns to see and sense inwardly  and interpret. But it
is dangerous for it to lay down its own laws or even laws and rules  which it thinks it can deduce from
some observed practice of the Overhead inspiration and  use that to wall in the inspiration; for it runs
the risk of seeing the Overhead inspiration  step across its wall and pass on leaving it bewildered and at a
loss. The mere critical  intellect not touched by a rarer sight can do little here. We can take an extreme
case,  for in extreme cases certain incompatibilities come out more clearly. What might be called  the
John-sonian critical method has obviously little or no place in this field, â€” the method  which expects
a precise logical order in thoughts and language and pecks at all that departs  from a matter-of-fact or
a strict and rational ideative coherence or a sober and restrained  classical taste. Johnson himself is
plainly out of his element when he deals crudely with  one of Gray's delicate trifles and tramples and
flounders about in the poet's basin of  goldfish breaking it with his heavy and vicious kicks. But also
this method is useless in  dealing with any kind of romantic poetry. What would the Johnsonian critic say
to Shakespeare's  famous lines,

<sup>1</sup> Quoting from memory, Sri Aurobindo has modified and given a wider poignancy to Richard
Baxter's first line which was in the original (Love breathing thanks and praise):<br /><br />

He would say, "What a mixture of metaphors and jumble of ideas! Only a lunatic could take up arms  against
a sea! A sea of troubles is too fanciful a metaphor and, in any case, one can't end the sea  by opposing it,
it is more likely to end you." Shakespeare knew very well what he was doing; he  saw the mixture as well as
any critic could and he accepted it because it brought home, with an  inspired force which a neater language
could not have had, the exact feeling and idea that he  wanted to bring out. Still more scared would the
Johnsonian be by any occult or mystic poetry.  The Veda, for instance, uses with what seems like a deliberate
recklessness the mixture, at  least the association of disparate images, of things not associated together
in the material  world which in Shakespeare is only an occasional departure. What would the Johnsonian make
of  this Rk in the Veda: "That splendour of thee, O Fire, which is in heaven and in the earth and  in the
plants and in the waters and by which thou hast spread out the wide mid-air, is a vivid  ocean of light
which sees with a divine seeing"? <sup>2</sup> He would say, "What is this nonsense? How can  there be a
splendour of light in plants and in water and how can an ocean of light see divinely  or otherwise? Anyhow,
what meaning can there be in all this, it is a senseless mystical jargon."  But, apart from these extremes,
the mere critical intellect is likely to feel a distaste or an  incomprehension with regard to mystical
poetry even if that poetry is quite coherent in its ideas  and well-appointed in its language. It is bound
to stumble over all sorts of things that are  contrary to its reason and offensive to its taste: association
of contraries, excess or abruptness  or crowding of images, disregard of intellectual limitations in the
thought, concretisation of  abstractions, the treating of things and forces as-if there were a conscious-ness
and a personality  in them and a hundred other aberrations from the straight intellectual line. It is not
likely  either to tolerate departures in technique which disregard the canons of an established order.
Fortunately here the modernists with all their errors have broken old bounds and the mystic poet  may
be</p>

more free to invent his own technique.<br /> <br />
Here is an instance in point. You refer to certain things I
wrote and concessions I made when  you were typing an earlier draft of the first books of Savitri. You
instance my readiness  to correct or do away with repetitions of words or clashes of sound such as
"magnificent"  in one line and "lucent" in the next. True, but I may observe that at that time I was passing
through a transition from the habits of an old inspiration and technique to which I often  deferred and the
new inspiration that had begun to come. I would still alter this clash  because it was a clash, but I would
not as in the old days make a fixed rule of this avoidance.  If lines like the following were to come to me
now,
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> His forehead was a dome magnificent,<br />
And there gazed forth two orbs of lucent truth<br />
That made the human air a world of light, </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
I would not reject them but accept "magnificent" and "lucent" as entirely in their place.  But this would not
be an undiscriminating acceptance; for if it had run

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> His forehead was a wide magnificent dome <br />
And there gazed forth two orbs of lucent truth </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
I would not be so ready to accept it, for the repetition of sound here occurring in the same  place in the
line would lack the just rhythmical balance. I have accepted in the present  version of Savitri several of
the freedoms established by the modernists including internal  rhyme, exact assonance of syllable,
irregularities introduced into the iambic run of the metre  and others which would have been equally
painful to an earlier taste. But I have not taken  this as a mechanical method or a mannerism, but only
where I thought it rhythmically justified;  for all freedom must have a truth in it and an order, either
a rational or an instinctive and  intuitive order.
