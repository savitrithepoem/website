<p class="savitri_text_justified">
Sri Aurobindo was born in Calcutta on August 15, 1872. In 1879, at the age of seven,  
he was taken with his two elder brothers to England for education and lived there for  
fourteen years. Brought up at first in an English family at Manchester, he joined St.  
Paul's School in London in 1884 and in 1890 went from it with a senior classical  
scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, where he studied for two years. In 1890  
he passed also the open competition for the Indian Civil Service, but at the end of  
two years of probation failed to present himself at the riding examination and was 
 disqualified for the Service. At this time the Gaekwar of Baroda was in London. 
 Aurobindo  saw him, obtained an appointment in the Baroda Service and left England for India,  
 arriving there in February, 1893.<br /> <br /> Sri Aurobindo passed thirteen years, 
 from 1893 to 1906, in the Baroda Service, first  in the Revenue Department and in secretariat 
 work for the Maharaja, afterwards as Professor  of English and, finally, Vice-Principal 
 in the Baroda College. These were years of self-culture,  of literary activity - for much 
 of the poetry afterwards published from Pondicherry was written  at this time - and of 
 preparation for his future work. In England he had received, according  to his father's 
 express instructions, an entirely occidental education without any contact with  the 
 culture of India and the East*. At Baroda he made up the deficiency, learned Sanskrit and  
 several modern Indian languages, assimilated the spirit of Indian civilisation and its forms  
 past and present. A great part of the last years of this period was spent on leave in silent  
 political activity, for he was debarred from public action by his position at Baroda.  
 The out-break of the agitation against the partition of Bengal in 1905 gave him the opportunity  
 to give up the Baroda Service and join openly in the political movement. He left Baroda in  
 1906 and went to Calcutta as Principal of the newly-founded Bengal National College.<br /> <br /> 
 
 The political action of Sri Aurobindo covered eight years, from 1902 to 1910. During the  first 
 half of this period he worked behind the scenes, preparing with other co-workers  the beginnings 
 of the Swadeshi (Indian Sinn Fein) movement, till the agitation in Bengal  furnished an opening 
 for the public initiation of a more forward and direct political action  than the moderate reformism
  which had till then been the creed of the Indian National Congress.  In 1906 Sri Aurobindo came to
   Bengal with this purpose and joined the New Party, an advanced  section small in numbers and not 
   yet strong in influence, which had been recently formed  in the Congress. The political theory 
   of this party was a rather vague gospel of Non-cooperation;  in action it had not yet gone 
   farther than some ineffective clashes with the Moderate  leaders at the annual Congress assembly 
   behind the veil of secrecy of the "Subjects  Committee". Sri Aurobindo persuaded its chiefs in 
   Bengal to come forward publicly as an  All-India party with a definite and challenging programme, 
   putting forward Tilak, the  popular Maratha leader at its head, and to attack the then dominant 
   Moderate  (Reformist or Liberal) oligarchy of veteran politicians and capture from them the 
   Congress  and the country. This was the origin of the historic struggle between the Moderates 
   and the  Nationalists (called by their opponents Extremists) which in two years changed altogether  
   the face of Indian politics.<br /> <br /> The new-born Nationalist party put forward Swaraj 
   (independence) as its goal as against  the far-off Moderate hope of colonial self-government to 
   be realised at a distant date  of a century or two by a slow progress of reform; it proposed as 
   its means of execution  a programme which resembled in spirit, though not in its details, the 
   policy of Sinn Fein  developed some years later and carried to a successful issue in Ireland. 
   The principle of  this new policy was self- help; it aimed on one side at an effective organisation 
   of the  forces of the nation and on the other professed a complete non-cooperation with the 
   Government.  Boycott of British and foreign goods and the fostering of Swadeshi industries to 
   replace  them, boycott of British law courts and the foundation of a system of Arbitration courts  
   in their stead, boycott of Government universities and colleges and the creation of a  network of 
   National colleges and schools, the formation of societies of young men which  would do the work of 
   police and defence and, wherever necessary, a policy of passive  resistance were among the immediate 
   items of the programme. Sri Aurobindo hoped to capture  the Congress and make it the directing 
   centre of an organised national action, an informal  State within the State, which would carry 
   on the struggle for freedom till it was won. He  persuaded the party to take up and finance as 
   its recognised organ the newly-founded daily  paper, Bande Mataram, of which he was at the time 
   acting editor. The Bande Mataram, whose  policy from the beginning of 1907 till its abrupt winding 
   up in 1908 when Aurobindo was  in prison was wholly directed by him, circulated almost immediately 
   all over India.  During its brief but momentous existence it changed the political thought of India 
    which has ever since preserved fundamentally, even amidst its later developments,  the stamp then
     imparted to it. But the struggle initiated on these lines, though  vehement and eventful and
      full of importance for the future, did not last long at the  time; for the country was still 
      unripe for so bold a programme.<br /> <br /> Sri Aurobindo was prosecuted for sedition in 
      1907 and acquitted. Up till now an organiser  and writer, he was obliged by this event and 
      by the imprisonment or disappearance of other  leaders to come forward as the acknowledged 
      head of the party in Bengal and to appear on  the platform for the first time as a speaker. 
      He presided over the Nationalist Conference  at Surat in 1907 where in the forceful clash of 
      two equal parties the Congress was broken  to pieces. In May, 1908, he was arrested in the 
      Alipore Conspiracy Case as implicated in  the doings of the revolutionary group led by his
       brother Barindra; but no evidence of any  value could be established against him and in 
       this case too he was acquitted. After a  detention of one year as undertrial prisoner
        in the Alipore Jail, he came out in May, 1909,  to find the party organisation broken, 
        its leaders scattered by imprisonment, deportation  or self-imposed exile and the party 
        itself still existent but dumb and dispirited and  incapable of any strenuous action. 
        For almost a year he strove single-handed as the sole  remaining leader of the Nationalists 
        in India to revive the movement. He published at this  time to aid his effort a weekly 
        English paper, the Karmayogin, and a Bengali weekly, the  Dharma. But at last he was 
        compelled to recognise that the nation was not yet sufficiently  trained to carry out 
        his policy and programme. For a time he thought that the necessary  training must first 
        be given through a less advanced Home Rule movement or an agitation  of passive resistance 
        of the kind created by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa. But he saw  that the hour of
         these movements had not come and that he himself was not their destined  leader.
          Moreover, since his twelve months' detention in the Alipore Jail, which had been  
          spent entirely in practice of Yoga, his inner spiritual life was pressing upon him 
          for an  exclusive concentration. He resolved therefore to withdraw from the political 
          field, at  least for a time**.<br /> <br /> In February, 1910, he withdrew to a secret 
          retirement at Chandernagore and in the beginning  of April sailed for Pondicherry in 
          French India. A third prosecution was launched against  him at this moment for a signed 
          article in the Karmayogin; in his absence it was pressed  against the printer of the paper 
          who was convicted, but the conviction was quashed on  appeal in the High Court of Calcutta. 
          For the third time a prosecution against him had  failed. Sri Aurobindo had left Bengal
           with some intention of returning to the political  field under more favourable circumstances;
            but very soon the magnitude of the spiritual  work he had taken up appeared to him and he 
            saw that it would need the exclusive  concentration of all his energies. Eventually he 
            cut off connection with politics,  refused repeatedly to accept the Presidentship of the 
            National Congress and went into  a complete retirement. During all his stay at Pondicherry 
            from 1910 onward he remained  more and more exclusively devoted to his spiritual work and 
            his sadhana.<br /> <br /> In 1914 after four years of silent Yoga he began the publication
             of a philosophical monthly,  the Arya. Most of his more important works, The Life Divine, 
             The Synthesis of Yoga,  Essays on the Gita, The Isha Upanishad, appeared serially in the 
             Arya. These works  embodied much of the inner knowledge that had come to him in his 
             practice of Yoga.  Others were concerned with the spirit and significance of Indian 
             civilisation and  culture (The Foundations of Indian Culture), the true meaning of the
              Vedas (The Secret  of the Veda), the progress of human society (The Human Cycle), the 
              nature and evolution  of poetry (The Future Poetry), the possibility of the unification 
              of the human race (The  Ideal of Human Unity). At this time also he began to publish his 
              poems, both those written  in England and at Baroda and those, fewer in number, added 
              during his period of political  activity and in the first years of his residence at 
              Pondicherry. The Arya ceased publication  in 1921 after six years and a half of 
              uninterrupted appearance.<br /> <br /> Sri Aurobindo lived at first in retirement at 
              Pondicherry with four or five disciples.  Afterwards more and yet more began to come to 
              him to follow his spiritual path and  the number became so large that a community of 
              sadhaks had to be formed for the maintenance  and collective guidance of those who had 
              left everything behind for the sake of a higher  life. This was the foundation of the 
              Sri Aurobindo Ashram which has less been created than  grown around him as its 
              centre.<br /> <br /> 
              
              Sri Aurobindo began his practice of Yoga in 1904. At first gathering into it the 
              essential elements of spiritual experience that are gained by the paths of divine  
              communion and spiritual realisation followed till now in India, he passed on in search  
              of a more complete experience uniting and harmonising the two ends of existence,  
              Spirit and Matter. Most ways of Yoga are paths to the Beyond leading to the Spirit  
              and, in the end, away from life; Sri Aurobindo's rises to the Spirit to redescend  
              with its gains bringing the light and power and bliss of the Spirit into life to  
              transform it. Man's present existence in the material world is in this view or vision 
               of things a life in the Ignorance with the In- conscient at its base, but even in its  
               darkness and nescience there are involved the presence and possibilities of the Divine.  
               The created world is not a mistake or a vanity and illusion to be cast aside by the  
               soul returning to heaven or Nirvana, but the scene of a spiritual evolution by which  
               out of this material inconscience is to be manifested progressively the Divine  
               Consciousness in things. Mind is the highest term yet reached in the evolution,  
               but it is not the highest of which it is capable. There is above it a Supermind  or 
               eternal Truth-Consciousness which is in its nature the self-aware and self-determining  
               light and power of a Divine Knowledge. Mind is an ignorance seeking after Truth, 
               but  this is a self-existent Knowledge harmoniously manifesting the play of its forms 
               and forces.  It is only by the descent of this Supermind that the perfection dreamed of
               by all that is  highest in humanity can come. It is possible by opening to a greater 
               divine consciousness  to rise to this power of light and bliss, discover one's true 
               self, remain in constant  union with the Divine and bring down the supramental Force 
               for the transformation of mind  and life and body. To realise this possibility has been 
               the dynamic aim of Sri Aurobindo's Yoga.<br /> <br /> Sri Aurobindo left his body on 
               December 5, 1950. The Mother carried on his work until  November 17, 1973. Their work 
               continues.<br /> <br /> 
               
               * It may be observed that Sri Aurobindo's education in England gave him a wide 
               introduction  to the culture of ancient, of mediaeval and of modern Europe. He was a 
               brilliant scholar  in Greek and Latin. He had learned French from his childhood in 
               Manchester and studied for  himself German and Italian sufficiently to study Goethe 
               and Dante in the original tongues.  (He passed the Tripos in Cambridge in the first 
               class and obtained record marks in Greek  and Latin in the examination for the Indian 
               Civil Service.)<br /> <br />
