<td class="td_poem_text" colspan="3"><br /> Out of the voiceless mystery of the past <br /> In a present ignorant of forgotten bonds <br /> These spirits met upon the roads of Time. <br /> Yet in the heart their secret conscious selves <br /> At once aware grew of each other warned <br /> By the first call of a delightful voice <br /> And a first vision of the destined face. <br /> As when being cries to being from its depths <br /> Behind the screen of the external sense <br /> And strives to find the heart-disclosing word, <br /> The passionate speech revealing the soul's need, <br /> But the mind's ignorance veils the inner sight, <br /> Only a little breaks through our earth-made bounds, <br /> So now they met in that momentous hour, <br /> So utter the recognition in the deeps, <br /> The remembrance lost, the oneness felt and missed. <br /> Thus Satyavan spoke first to Savitri: <br /> "O thou who com'st to me out of Time's silences, <br /> Yet thy voice has wakened my heart to an unknown bliss, <br /> Immortal or mortal only in thy frame, <br /> For more than earth speaks to me from thy soul <br /> And more than earth surrounds me in thy gaze, <br /> How art thou named among the sons of men? <br /> Whence hast thou dawned filling my spirit's days, <br /> Brighter than summer, brighter than my flowers, <br /> Into the lonely borders of my life, <br /> O sunlight moulded like a golden maid? <br /> I know that mighty gods are friends of earth. <br /> Amid the pageantries of day and dusk, <br /> Long have I travelled with my pilgrim soul <br /> Moved by the marvel of familiar things. <br /></td>

Let thy journey cease, come down to us. <br /> Close is my father's creepered hermitage <br /> Screened by the tall ranks of these silent kings, <br /> Sung to by voices of the hue-robed choirs <br /> Whose chants repeat transcribed in music's notes <br /> The passionate coloured lettering of the boughs <br /> And fill the hours with their melodious cry. <br /> Amid the welcome-hum of many bees <br /> Invade our honied kingdom of the woods; <br /> There let me lead thee into an opulent life. <br /> Bare, simple is the sylvan hermit-life; <br /> Yet is it clad with the jewelry of earth. <br /> Wild winds run--visitors midst the swaying tops, <br /> Through the calm days heaven's sentinels of peace <br /> Couched on a purple robe of sky above <br /> Look down on a rich secrecy and hush <br /> And the chambered nuptial waters chant within. <br /> Enormous, whispering, many-formed around <br /> High forest gods have taken in their arms <br /> The human hour, a guest of their centuried pomps. <br /> Apparelled are the morns in gold and green, <br /> Sunlight and shadow tapestry the walls <br /> To make a resting chamber fit for thee." <br /> Awhile she paused as if hearing still his voice, <br /> Unwilling to break the charm, then slowly spoke. <br /> Musing she answered, "I am Savitri, <br /> Princess of Madra. Who art thou? What name <br /> Musical on earth expresses thee to men? <br /> What trunk of kings watered by fortunate streams <br /></td>

Earth's morns were mine; <br /> Lured by faint murmurings with the green-robed hours <br /> I wandered lost in woods, prone to the voice <br /> Of winds and waters, partner of the sun's joy, <br /> A listener to the universal speech: <br /> My spirit satisfied within me knew <br /> Godlike our birthright, luxuried our life <br /> Whose close belongings are the earth and skies. <br /> Before Fate led me into this emerald world, <br /> Aroused by some foreshadowing touch within, <br /> An early prescience in my mind approached <br /> The great dumb animal consciousness of earth <br /> Now grown so close to me who have left old pomps <br /> To live in this grandiose murmur dim and vast. <br /> Already I met her in my spirit's dream. <br /> As if to a deeper country of the soul <br /> Transposing the vivid imagery of earth, <br /> Through an inner seeing and sense a wakening came. <br /> A visioned spell pursued my boyhood's hours, <br /> All things the eye had caught in coloured lines <br /> Were seen anew through the interpreting mind <br /> And in the shape it sought to seize the soul. <br /> An early child-god took my hand that held, <br /> Moved, guided by the seeking of his touch, <br /> Bright forms and hues which fled across his sight; <br /> Limned upon page and stone they spoke to men. <br /> High beauty's visitants my intimates were. <br /> The neighing pride of rapid life that roams <br /> Wind-maned through our pastures, on my seeing mood <br /> Cast shapes of swiftness; trooping spotted deer <br /></td>
