<p class="savitri_text_justified">
I am not disposed to change "suns" to "stars" in the line about the creative slumber of the  ignorant Force;
"stars" does not create the same impression and brings in a different tone in  the rhythm and the sense.
This line and that which follows it bring in a general subordinate idea  stressing the paradoxical nature
of the creation and the contrasts which it contains, the drowsed  somnambulist as the mother of the light
of the suns and the activities of life. It is not intended  as a present feature in the darkness of the
Night.

</i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
Your objection to the "finger" and the "clutch" moves me only to change "reminding" to "reminded"
in the second line. It is not intended that the two images "finger laid" and "clutch" should correspond
exactly to each other; for the "void"<sup>3</sup> and the "Mother of the universe" are not the same thing.
The  "void" is only a mask covering the Mother's cheek or face. What the "void" feels as a clutch is felt
by the Mother only as a reminding finger laid on her cheek. It is one advantage of the expression "as if"
that it leaves the field open for such variation. It is intended to suggest without saying it that  behind
the sombre void is the face of a mother. The two other "as if"'s <sup>4</sup> have the same motive and I
do not find them

also called the void.<br />

jarring upon me. The second is at a sufficient distance from the first and it is not  obtrusive enough to
prejudice the third which more nearly follows... Your suggestion "as though" (for the third) does not
appeal to me: it almost  makes a suggestion of falsity and in any case it makes no real difference as the
two expressions  are too much kin to each other to repel the charge of reiteration.

</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
You have made what seems to me a strange confusion as regards the passage about the "errant marvel"  owing
to the mistake in the punctuation which is now corrected. You took the word "solicited" as a  past
participle passive and this error seems to have remained fixed in your mind so as to distort  the whole
building and sense of the passage. The word "solicited" is the past tense and the subject  of this verb is
"an errant marvel" delayed to the fourth line by the parenthesis "Orphaned etc."  This kind of inversion,
though longer than usual, is common enough in poetical style and the object  is to throw a strong emphasis
and prominence upon the line, "An errant marvel with no place to live."  That being explained, the rest about
the gesture should be clear enough.<br /> <br />

I see no sufficient reason to alter the passage; certainly, I
could not alter the line beginning  "Orphaned..."; it is indispensable to the total idea and its omission
would leave an unfilled gap.  If I may not expect a complete alertness from the reader, - but how without
it can he grasp the  subtleties of a mystical and symbolic poem ? - he surely ought to be alert enough
when he reads the  second line to see that it is somebody who is soliciting with a timid grace and it
can't be somebody  who is being gracefully solicited; also the line "Orphaned etc." ought to suggest
to him at once that  it is some orphan who is soliciting and not the other way round: the delusion of
the past participle  passive ought to be dissipated long before he

Man alive, your proposed emendations<sup>1</sup> are an admirable exposition of the art of bringing a line
down the steps till my poor "slow miraculous" above-mind line meant to give or begin the concrete  portrayal
of an act of some hidden Godhead finally becomes a mere metaphor thrown out from its more  facile mint by a
brilliantly imaginative poetic intelligence. First of all, you shift my "dimly" out  of the way and transfer
it to something to which it does not inwardly belong, make it an epithet of  the gesture or an adverb
qualifying its epithet instead of something that qualifies the atmosphere  in which the act of the Godhead
takes place. That is a preliminary havoc which destroys what is very  important to the action, its atmosphere. I never intended the gesture to be dim, it is a luminous gesture,  but forcing its way through the black quietude it comes dimly. Then again the bald phrase "a gesture came"  without anything to psychicise it becomes simply something that "happened", "came" being a poetic equivalent  for "happened", instead of the expression of the slow coming of the gesture.

because of a new interrelation in the final expanded recast of his poem).
They were only a hypothetical  desperate resort in the interests of a point which is made clear in the
footnote at the end of the next  item. The object was to see if a certain change in the manner of
adjective-use was possible so that a  technical variety might be introduced in the passage of which
the line in question was a part. The  emendations unfortunately involved, among other things, the
omission of one or another of the descriptive  terms used by Sri Aurobindo. But variants not involving
this were also offered for discussion, as the  footnote already referred to will show.

words "slow" and "dimly" assure this sense of motion and this concreteness to the word's sense here.
Remove one or both whether entirely or elsewhere and you ruin the vision and change altogether its character.
That is at least what happens wholly in your penultimate version and as for the last its "came" gets another
meaning and one feels that somebody very slowly decided to let out the gesture from himself and it was quite a
miracle that it came out at all! "Dimly miraculous" means what precisely or what "miraculously dim" - it was
miraculous that it managed to be so dim or there was something vaguely miraculous about it after all? No doubt
they try to mean something else - but these interpretations come in their way and trip them over. The only thing
that can stand is the first version which is no doubt fine poetry, but the trouble is that it does not give the
effect I wanted to give, the effect which is necessary for the dawn's inner significance. Moreover, what becomes of the
slow lingering rhythm of my line which is absolutely indispensable?

now stands demands that it should begin:<br /><br />

be used to bring it about - and the double adjective is admirably suited for the purpose....
Do not  forget that Savitri is an experiment in mystic poetry, spiritual poetry cast into a symbolic
figure.  Done on this rule, it is really a new attempt and cannot be hampered by old ideas of technique except
when they are assimilable. Least of all by a standard proper to a mere intellectual and abstract poetry  which
makes "reason and taste" the supreme arbiters, aims at a harmonised poetic intellectual balanced  expression of the
sense, elegance in language, a sober and subtle use of imaginative decoration, a  restrained emotive element etc.
The attempt at mystic spiritual poetry of the kind I am at demands  above all a spiritual objectivity, an
intense psychophysical concreteness. I do not know what you  mean exactly here by  "obvious" and "subtle".
According to certain canons, epithets should be used sparingly, free use of  them is rhetorical, an "obvious" device,
a crowding of images is bad taste, there should be subtlety  of art not displayed but severely concealed -
Summa ars est celare artem. Very good for a certain  standard of poetry, not so good or not good at all for
others. Shakespeare kicks over these traces  at every step, Aeschylus freely and frequently, Milton whenever he
chooses. Such lines as</p>

(note two double adjectives in three lines in the last) - are not subtle or restrained, or careful
to conceal their elements of powerful technique, they show rather a vivid richness or vehemence, forcing
language to its utmost power of expression. That has to be done still more in this kind of mystic poetry.
I cannot bring out the spiritual objectivity if I have to be miserly about epithets, images, or deny myself
the use of all available resources of sound-significance. The double epithets are indispensable here and
in the exact order</p>

<br />
in which they are arranged by me. You say the rich burdened movement can be secured by other  means, but a rich
burdened movement of any kind is not my primary object, it is desirable only because it is  needed to express
the spirit of the action here; and the double epithets are wanted because they are the  best, not only one way
of securing it. The "gesture" must be "slow miraculous" - if it is merely  miraculous or merely slow, that does
not create a picture of the thing as it is, but of something  quite abstract and ordinary or concrete but ordinary -
it is the combination that renders the exact  nature of the mystic movement, with the "dimly came" supporting it,
so that "gesture" is not here a  metaphor, but a thing actually done. Equally a pale light or an enchanted light
may be very pretty,  but it is only the combination that renders the luminosity which is that of the hand acting
tentatively  in the darkness. That darkness itself is described as a quietude, which gives it a subjective spiritual
character and brings out the thing symbolised, but the double epithet "inert black" gives it the needed concreteness
so that the quietude ceases to be something abstract and becomes  something concrete, objective, but still spiritually
subjective.... Every word must be the right word,  with the right atmosphere, the right relation to all the other
words, just as every sound in its place  and the whole sound together must bring out the imponderable significance which
is beyond verbal expression.  One can't chop and change about on the principle that it is sufficient if the same
mental sense or part of   it is given with some poetical beauty or power. One can only change if the change brings
out more perfectly   the thing behind that is seeking for expression - brings out in full objectivity and also in the
full   mystic sense. If I can do that, well, other considerations have to take a backseat or seek their   satisfaction
elsewhere.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> The point discussed by Sri Aurobindo is a genuine and important one but it may be mentioned  that
the question which elicited the discussion gave rise to this precise point by some carelessness of  phrasing.
As Sri Aurobindo himself was informed later, the slight suspicion of "obviousness of method"  referred not to
the closely repeated use of double adjectives but to the manner in which two epithets  had been thus used -
that is, without any separation of one from the other and immediately before a noun.  An alternative -
"A gesture slow, miraculous, dimly came" - was suggested, but admittedly the revelatory  suspense in Sri Aurobindo's
line was spoiled by the "gesture" being mentioned too soon. Also,  "Miraculous, slow, a gesture dimly came"
would blurt out things in its own way. "Yes, that is it,"  wrote Sri Aurobindo. And his general remark was:
"The epithets are inseparable from the noun, they  give a single impression which must not be broken up by giving a
separate prominence to either  noun or epithets."<br /><br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
<br />
In the passage about Dawn your two suggestions I find unsatisfying. "Windowing hidden things"<sup>1</sup>
presents  a vivid image and suggests what I want to suggest and I must refuse to alter it; "vistaing"
brings in a  very common image and does not suggest anything except perhaps that there is a long line or wide
range  of hidden things. But that is quite unwanted and not a part of the thing seen. "Shroud" sounds to me  too
literary and artificial and besides it almost suggests that what it covers is a corpse which would  not do at all;
a slipping shroud sounds inapt while "slipped like a falling cloak"<sup>2</sup> gives a natural  and true image.
In any case, "shroud" would not be more naturally continuous in the succession of  images than "cloak".</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
I am afraid I shall not be able to satisfy your demand for rejection and alteration of the lines
about the Inconscient<sup>3</sup> and the cloak any more than I could do it with regard to the  line about the
silence and strength of the gods.<sup>4</sup> I looked at your suggestion about adding a line or two in the
first  case, but could get nothing that would either improve the passage or set your objection at rest. I am
quite unable to agree that there is anything jargonish about the line any more than there is in the  lines of Keats,

Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty - that is all <br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
That amounts to a generalised philosophical statement or enunciation and the words "beauty" and "truth"
are abstract metaphysical terms to which we give a concrete and emotional value because they are connected
in our associations with true. and beautiful things of which our senses or our minds are vividly aware. Men
have not learnt yet to recognise the Inconscient on which the whole material world they see is built, or
the Ignorance of which their</p>

whole nature including their knowledge is built; they think that these words  are only abstract metaphysical
jargon flung about by the philosophers in their clouds or laboured out in  long and wearisome books like The
Life Divine. But it is not so with me and I take my stand on my own  feeling and experience about them as Keats
did on his about truth and beauty. My readers will have to  do the same if they want to appreciate my poetry, which
of course they are not bound to do.<br /><br />
Is it really a fact that even the ordinary reader would not be able to see
any difference between the  Inconscient and Ignorance unless the difference is expressly explained to him? This is not
a matter of  philosophical terminology but of common sense and the understood meaning of English words. One would say
"even the inconscient stone" but one would not say, as one might of a child, "the ignorant stone". One  must first be
conscious before one can be ignorant. What is true is that the ordinary reader might not  be familiar with the philosophical
content of the word Inconscient and might not be familiar with the  Vedantic idea of the Ignorance as the power behind the
manifested world. But I don't see how I can  acquaint him with these things in a single line, even with the most illuminating
image or symbol. He  might wonder, if he were Johnsonianly minded, how an Inconscient could be teased or how it
could wake  Ignorance. I am afraid, in the absence of a miracle of inspired poetical exegesis flashing through my
mind, he will have to be left wondering. I am not set against adding a line if the miracle   comes or if some vivid
symbol occurs to me, but as yet none such is making its   appearance.<sup>1</sup>
<br /><br />

In the other case also, about the cloak, I maintain my position. Here, however,  while I was looking at
the passage an additional line occurred to me and I may keep it:</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> The darkness failed and slipped like a falling cloak <br />
From the reclining body of a god. </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
But this additional line does not obviate your objection and it was
</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> What the commentator wished for was some symbolic suggestion as in other phrases of Sri
Aurobindo's that made the Inconscient a black dragon or a black rock. As an alternative he desired a further
touch of vividness to drive home the distinction between the Inconscient and Ignorance, as in another line in Savitri:
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
And the blind Void struggles to live and see.<br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
not put in with that object. You  have, by the way, made a curious misapplication of my image of the careful housewife;
you attribute this  line to her inspiration.<sup>1</sup> A careful housewife is meticulously and methodically careful
to arrange  everything in a perfect order, to put every object in its place and see that there is no disharmony  anywhere;
but according to you she has thrust a wrong object into a wrong place, something discordant  with the surroundings and
inferior in beauty to all that is near it; if so, she is not a careful housewife  but a slattern. The Muse has a careful
housewife, - there is Pope's, perfect in the classical or  pseudo-classical style or Tennyson's, in the romantic or
semi-romantic manner, while as a contrast  there is Browning's with her energetic and rough-and-tumble dash and
clatter.<br /><br />
You ask why in these and similar cases I could not convince you while I did in others. Well, there  are several
possible explanations. It may be that your first reaction to these lines was very vivid and  left the mark of a
samskar which could not be obliterated. Or perhaps I was right in the other matters  while your criticism may
have been right in these, - my partiality for these lines may be due to an  unjustified personal attachment
founded on the vision which they gave me when I wrote them. Again, there  are always differences of poetical
appreciation due either to preconceived notions or to different  temperamental reactions. Finally, it may be that
my vision was true but for some reason you are not  able to share it. For instance, you may have seen in the line
about the cloak only the objective image  in a detailed picture of the dawn where I felt a subjective suggestion
in the failure of the darkness  and the slipping of the cloak, not an image but an experience. It must be the same
with the line,</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> The strength, the silence of the gods were hers. </i>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
You perhaps felt it to be an ordinary line with a superficial significance; perhaps it conveyed to  you not much
more than the stock phrase about the "strong silent man" admired by biographers, while to  me it meant very much

Your "barely enough", instead of the finer and more suggestive "hardly", falls flat upon my ear;
one cannot substitute one word for another in this kind of poetry merely because it means intellectually  the
same thing; "hardly" is the mot juste in this context and, repetition or not, it must remain unless  a word not
or only juste but inevitable comes to replace it.... On this point I may add that in certain  contexts "barely"
would be the right word, as for instance, "There is barely enough food left for two or  three meals", where "hardly"
would be adequate but much less forceful. It is the other way about in this  line.</p>

No word will do except "invisible". I don't think there are too many "I's" - in fact such  multiplications of a

It is a "connecting" line which prepares for what follows. It is sometimes good technique, as  I think, to
intersperse lines like that (provided they do not fall below standard), so as to give the  intellect the
foothold of a clear unadorned statement of the gist of what is coming, before taking a  higher flight. This
is of course a technique for long poems and long descriptions, not for shorter  things or lyrical writing.</p>

I refuse entirely to admit that that is poor poetry. It is not only just the line that is needed  to introduce what
follows but it is very good poetry with the strength and pointed directness, not  intellectualised like Pope's,
but intuitive, which we often find in the Elizabethans, for instance  in Marlowe supporting adequately and often
more than adequately his "mighty lines". But the image must  be understood, as it was intended, in its concrete
sense and not as a vague rhetorical phrase substituted  for a plainer wording, - it shows Savitri as the forerunner
or first creator of a new race. All poets have  lines which are bare and direct statements and meant to be that in
order to carry their full force; but  to what category their simplicity belongs or whether a line is only passable
or more than that depends  on various circumstances. Shakespeare's</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>To be or not to be, that is the question<sup>2</sup> </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
introduces powerfully one of the most famous of all soliloquies and it comes in with a great dramatic  force,
but in itself it is a bare statement and some might say that it would not be otherwise written in  prose and is
only saved by the metrical rhythm. The same might be said of the well-known passage in Keats  which I have already quoted:</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty - that is all<br />
Ye know on earth and all ye need to know. </i></div>

It might be said that the first line has nothing to distinguish it and is merely passable or  only saved by the
charm of what follows; but there is a beauty of rhythm and a bhava or feeling  brought in by the rhythm which makes the
line beautiful in itself and not merely passable. If there  is not some saving grace like that then the danger of
laxity may become possible. I do not think  there is much in Savltri which is of that kind. But I can perfectly
understand your anxiety that all  should be lifted to or towards at least the minimum Overhead level or so near as to
be touched by its  influence or at the very least a good substitute for it. I do not know whether that is always
possible  in so long a poem as Savitri dealing with so many various heights and degrees and so much varying
substance of thought and feeling and descriptive matter and narrative. But that has been my general  aim throughout
and it is the reason why I have made so many successive drafts and continual  alterations till I felt that I had got the
thing intended by the higher inspiration in every line  and passage. It is also why I keep myself open to every suggestion
from a sympathetic and understanding  quarter and weigh it well, rejecting only after due consideration and accepting when
I see it to be  well-founded. But for that the critic must be one who has seen and felt what is in the thing written,
not like your friend who has not seen anything and understood only the word surface and not even always  that; he must
be open to this kind of poetry, able to see the spiritual vision it conveys, capable  too of feeling the Overhead
touch when it comes, - the fit reader.</p>

I am unable to accept the alterations you suggest<sup>2</sup> because they are romantically decorative  and do not
convey any impression of directness and reality which is necessary in this style of writing.  A "sapphire sky" is
too obvious and common and has no significance in connection with the word  "magnanimity" or its idea and "boundless"
is somewhat meaningless and inapt when applied to sky.  The same objections apply to both "opulence" and "amplitude";
but apart from that they have only  a rhetorical value and are not the right word for what I want to say. Your "life's
wounded wings of  dream" and "the wounded wings of life" have also a very pronounced note of romanticism and do not
agree with the strong reality of things stressed everywhere in this passage. In the poem I dwell  often upon the
idea of life as a dream, but here it would bring in a false note. It does not seem  to me that magnanimity and
greatness are the same thing or that this can be called a repetition. I  myself see no objection to "heaven" and 
"haven"; it is not as if they were in successive lines;  they are divided by two lines and it is surely an
excessively meticulous ear that can take their  similarity of sound at this distance as an offence. Most of
your other objections</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text"> 
<sup>1</sup> The statement was in reply to the question: "Are not these lines which I regard as the  ne plus
ultra in world-poetry a snatch of the sheer Overmind?" Considering Sri Aurobindo's remark  in 1946 about his
attitude ten years earlier - "At that time I hesitated to assign anything like  Overmind touch or inspiration to
passages in English or other poetry and did not presume to claim  any of my own writing as belonging to this order" -
and considering also that several lines  of other poets which he had hesitated about were later adjudged by him to be
from  the Overmind, it seems certain that this passage which he had ascribed to the Overmind Intuition,
a plane defined by him as not Overmind itself but an intermediate level, would have been traced by  him to
the supreme source if he had been privately asked about it again.<br /><br />
<sup>2</sup> The alterations were suggested with reference to an additional passage between lines  20 and
21 in the description of Savitri as originally written in 1936. The passage was more or  less the same as
at present on p. 15, between lines 15 and 34 there, except that after line 21  and before line 28
stood the following:<br /><br /></p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px"><i>
As to a sheltering bosom a stricken bird<br />
Escapes with tired wings from a world of storms,<br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
hang upon your  over scrupulous law against repetitions....! consider that this law has no value in the technique
of a mystic poem of this kind and that repetition of a certain kind can be even part of the technique;  for instance,
I see no objection to "sea" being repeated in a different context in the same passage or  to the image of the ocean
being resorted to in a third connection. I cannot see that the power and  force or inevitability of these lines is
at all diminished in their own context by their relative  proximity or that that proximity makes each less
inevitable in its place.<br /> <br />
Then about the image about the bird and the bosom I understand what you mean,
but it rests upon the  idea that the whole passage must be kept at the same transcendental level. It is true
that all the  rest gives the transcendental values in the composition of Savitri's being, while here there is a
departure to  show how this transcendental greatness contacts the psychic demand of human nature in its weakness
and responds to it and acts upon it. That was the purpose of the new passage and it is difficult to
accomplish it without bringing in a normal psychic instead of a transcendental tone. The image of the  bird and the
bosom is obviously not new and original, it images a common demand of the human heart and  does it by employing a
physical and emotional figure so as to give it a vivid directness in its own  kind. This passage was introduced
because it brought in something in Savitri's relation with the human  world which seemed to me a necessary part
of a complete psychological description of her. If it had to  be altered, - which would be only if the descent
to the psychic level really spoils the consistent  integrality of the description and lowers the height of
the poetry, - I would have to find something  equal and better, and just now I do not find any such
satisfying alteration.<br /> <br />As for the line, about the strength and silence of the Gods,</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>[The strength, the silence of the gods were hers<sup>1</sup>] </i><br />

render that element into the poise of the spiritual consciousness; this last line brings the same  thing down
to the outward character and temperament in life. A union of strength and silence is  insisted upon in this poem
as one of the most prominent characteristics of Savitri and I have dwelt  on it elsewhere, but it had to be brought
in here also if this description other was to be complete.  I do not find that this line lacks poetry or power; if

The suggestion you make about the "soul" and the "bird" may have a slight justification, but I do  not think it is
fatal to the passage.<sup>1</sup> On the other hand there is a strong objection to the alteration  you propose;
it is that the image of the soul escaping from a world of storms would be impaired if it  were only a physical
bird that was escaping: a "world of storms" is too big an expression in relation  to the smallness of the bird,
it is only with the soul especially mentioned or else suggested and the  "bird" subordinately there as a comparison
that it fits perfectly well and gets its full value.<br /> <br />
The word "one" which takes up the image of the "bird"
has a more general application than the "soul" and is not quite identical with it; it means  anyone who has lost
happiness and is in need of spiritual comfort and revival. It is as if  one said: "as might a soul like a hunted
bird take refuge from the world in the peace of the  Infinite and feel that as its own remembered home, so could
one take refuge in her as in a  haven of safety and like the tired bird reconstitute one's strength so as to face

<sup>1</sup> The suggestion was: "Although your new version carries a subtle multiform image more
in tune, in my opinion, with the general vision of the rest of the description of Savitri, 'one'
who is himself a soul is compared to 'a soul' acting like a bird taking shelter, as if to say: 'A
soul who is doing so-and-so is like a soul doing something similar' - a comparison which perhaps
brings in some loss of surprise and revelation."<br /><br />

As to the sixfold repetition of the indefinite article "a" in this passage, one should  no doubt make it a general rule to
avoid any such excessive repetition, but all rules have  their exception and it might be phrased like this, "Except when
some effect has to be  produced which the repetition would serve or for which it is necessary." Here I feel  that it does
serve subtly such an effect; I have used the repetition of this "a" very  frequently m the poem with a recurrence at the
beginning of each successive line in  order to produce an accumulative effect of multiple characteristics or a grouping of
associated things or ideas or other similar massings.</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
The line you object to on account of forced rhythm "in a triumph of fire" has not been  so arranged
through negligence. It was very deliberately done and deliberately maintained.  If it were altered the
whole effect of rhythmic meaning and suggestion which I intended would  be lost and the alterations you
suggest would make a good line perhaps but with an ordinary  and inexpressive rhythm. Obviously this is
not a "natural rhythm", but there is no objection  to its being forced when it is a forcible and violent
action that has to be suggested. The rhythm cannot be called artificial, for that would  mean something not
true and genuine or significant but only patched up and insincere:  the rhythm here is a turn of art and not a
manufacture. The scansion is iamb, reversed  spondee, pyrrhic, trochee, iamb. By reversed spondee I mean
a foot with the first syllable  long and highly stressed and the second stressed but short or with a less
heavy ictus.  In the ordinary spondee the greater ictus is on the second syllable while there are  equal
spondees with two heavy stresses, e.g. "vast space" or in such a line as</p>

In the first part of the line the rhythm is appropriate to the violent breaking in of  the truth while
in the second half it expresses a high exultation and exaltation in  the inrush. This is brought out by
the two long and highly stressed vowels in the  first syllable of "triumph" and in the word "fire" (which i
n the elocution of the  line have to be given their full force), coming after a pyrrhic with two short
syllables between them. If one slurs over the slightly weighted short syllable  in "triumph" where the
concluding consonants exercise a certain check and delay  in the voice, one could turn this half line
into a very clumsy double anapaest,  the first a glide and the second a stumble; this would be bad
elocution and  contrary to the natural movement of the words.</p>

altogether, one into the slow massiveness of the "still brooding face", with its

It ["resiled"] is a perfectly good English word, meaning originally to leap back,
rebound (like an elastic) - so to draw back from, recoil, retreat (in military
language it means to fall back from a position gained or to one's original position);
but it is specially used for withdrawing from a contract, agreement, previous
statement. It is therefore quite the just word here. Human nature has assented
to Nature's terms and been kept by her to them, but now Aswapathy resiles from
the contract and the assent to it made by humanity to which he belonged.  Resiled,
resilient, resilience are all good words and in use.

an enormous difference between the force of the two words and surely "attracted

be  admitted. Neither do I want "thrill" [in place of "joy"] which gives a false
colour - precisely it would mean that the ecstasy was already touching him with
its intensity which is far from intention. <br /> <br />Your statement that "joy" is just
another word for "ecstasy" is surprising.  "Comfort", "pleasure", "joy", "bliss",
"rapture", "ecstasy" would then be  all equal and exactly synonymous terms and all
distinction of shades and  colours or words would disappear from literature. As
well say that "flashlight"  is just another word for "lightning" - or that glow,
gleam, glitter, sheen,  blaze are all equivalents which can be employed indifferently
in the same place.  One can feel allured to the supreme omniscient Ecstasy and feel
a nameless joy  touching one without that joy becoming itself the supreme Ecstasy.
I see no loss  of expressiveness by the joy coming in as a vague nameless hint of
the immeasurable  superior Ecstasy.</p>

As to the title of the three cantos about the Yoga of the King,<sup>1</sup> I
intended the  repetition of the word "Yoga" to bring out and emphasise the fact
that this part  of Aswapathy's spiritual development consisted of two Yogic
movements, one a  psycho-spiritual transformation and the other a greater spiritual
transformation  with an ascent to a supreme power. The omission which you suggest
would destroy  this significance and leave only something more abstract. In the
second of these  three cantos there is a pause between the two movements and a
description of the  secret knowledge to which he is led and of which the results
are described in the  last canto, but there is no description of the Yoga itself
or of the steps by which  this knowledge came. That is only indicated, not narrated;
so, to bring in "The Yoga  of the King" as the title of this canto would not be very
apposite. Aswapathy's Yoga  falls into three parts. First, he is achieving his own
spiritual self-fulfilment as  the individual and this is described as the Yoga of
the King. Next, he makes the  ascent as a typical representative of the race to
win the possibility of discovery  and possession of all the planes of consciousness
and this is described in the  Second Book: but this too is as yet only an individual
victory. Finally, he aspires  no longer for himself but for all, for a universal
realisation and new creation.  That is described in the Book of the Divine Mother.</p>

An evolution from the Inconscient<sup>2</sup> need not be a painful one if there
is  no resistance; it can be a deliberately slow and beautiful efflorescence  of
the Divine. One ought to be able to see how beautiful outward Nature can be and
usually is, although it is itself apparently "inconscient" - why  should the
growth of consciousness in inward Nature be attended by so  much ugliness and evil</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> p. 221.<br />
<sup>2</sup>The question was in reference to a passage in the 1936 version which
in  the present one is much enlarged and runs from "It was the gate of a false
infinite" to "None can reach heaven who has not passed through hell"  (pp. 221-227):
"The passage suggests that there was an harmonious original  plan of the Overmind
Gods for earth's evolution, but that it was spoiled  by the intrusion of the
Rakshasic worlds. I should, however, have thought  that an evolution, arising
from the stark ineonscient's sleep and the mute  void, would hardly be an harmonious
plan. The Rakshasas only shield  themselves with the covering 'Ignorance', they
don't create it. Do you  mean that, if they had not interfered, there wouldn't
have been resistance  and conflict and suffering? How can they be called the
artificers of  Nature's fall and pain?"<br /><br />

spoiling the beauty of the outward creation?  Because of a perversity born from
the Ignorance, which came in with  Life and increased in Mind - that is the Falsehood,
the Evil that was  born because of the starkness of the Inconscient's sleep
separating its  action from the secret luminous Conscience that is all the time
within it.  But it need not have been so except for the overriding Will of the
Supreme  which meant that the possibilities of Perversion by inconscience and
ignorance should be manifested in order to be eliminated through being  given
their chance, since all possibility has to manifest somewhere: once  it is
eliminated the Divine Manifestation in Matter will be greater than  it otherwise
could be because it will combine all the possibilities involved  in this difficult
creation and not some of them as in an easier and less  strenuous creation might naturally happen.</p>

"From beauty to greater beauty, from joy to intenser joy, by a special  adjustment
of the senses" - yes, that would be the normal course of a  divine manifestation,
however gradual, in Matter. "Discordant sound and  offensive odour" are creations
of a disharmony between consciousness and  Nature and do not exist in themselves,
they would not be present in a  liberated and harmonised consciousness for they
would be foreign to its  being, nor would they afflict a rightly developing harmonised
soul and  Nature. Even the "belching volcano, crashing thunderstorm and whirling
typhoon" are in themselves grandiose and beautiful things and only  harmful or
terrible to a consciousness unable to meet or deal with  them or make a pact with
the spirits of Wind and Fire. You are assuming  that the manifestation from the
Inconscient must be what it is now and  here and that no other kind of world of
Matter was possible, but the harmony  of material Nature in itself shows that it
need not necessarily be a  discordant, evil, furiously perturbed and painful
creation - the psychic  being if allowed to manifest from the first in Life and
Mind and lead the  evolution instead of being relegated behind the veil would
have been the  principle of a harmony out-flowing; everyone who has felt the
psychic at  work within him, free from the vital intervention, can at once
see that  this would be its effect because of its unerring perception, true choice,
harmonic action. If it has not been so, it is because the dark Powers have<br /><br /></p>

in the purity of its own principle - it is only if it is  disturbed or perverted

been a progressing harmony, not a series of  discords through which harmony of a
precarious and wounded kind has to be  struggled for at each step; for the Divine

evolution of the inner being and  the abrupt end or failure of all that had been
done unless it could suddenly  transcend itself and become something greater. I do
not think that this line  in its context is merely passable, but I admit that it
is less elevated and  intense than what precedes or what follows. I do not see how
that can be avoided  without truncating the thought significance of the whole
account by the omission  of something necessary to its evolution or else
overpitching the expression where  it needs to be direct or clear and bare in
its lucidity.  In any case the emended version - "All he had been and all towards

passable as it  raises both the idea and the expression through the vividness
