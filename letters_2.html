As to the many criticisms<sup>1</sup> contained in your letter I have a good deal to  say; some of 
them bring forward questions of the technique of mystic poetry  about which I wanted to write in an 
introduction to Savitri when it is  published, and I may as well say something about that here.<br /> 
...Rapid transitions from one image to another are a constant feature in  Savitri as in most mystic 
poetry. I am not here<sup>2</sup> building a long sustained  single picture of the Dawn with a single 
continuous image or variations of  the same image. I am describing a rapid series of transitions, 
piling one  suggestion upon another. There is first a black quietude, then the  persistent touch, 
then the first "beauty and wonder" leading to the magical  gate and the "lucent corner". Then comes 
the failing of the darkness, the  simile used ("a falling cloak") suggesting the rapidity of the 
change. Then  as a result the change of what was once a rift into a wide luminous gap, -  if you want 
to be logically consistent you can look at the rift as a slit in  the "cloak" which becomes a big tear. 
Then all changes into a "brief  perpetual sign", the iridescence, then the blaze and the magnificent 
aura.  In such a race of rapid transitions you cannot bind me down to a logical  chain of figures or 
a classical monotone. The mystic Muse is more of an  inspired Bacchante of the Dionysian wine than an 
orderly housewife.<br /> ...Again, do you seriously want me to give an accurate scientific  
description of the earth half in darkness and half in light so as
</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> The nature of these  criticism must not be misunderstood. Just as the merits of Savitri 
were  appreciated to the utmost, whatever seems a shortcoming no matter how slight  and negligible 
in the midst of the abundant excellence was pointedly  remarked upon so that Sri Aurobindo might not 
overlook anything in his work  towards what he called "perfect perfection" before the poem came 
under the  scrutiny of non-Aurobindonian critics at the time of publication. The  commentator was 
anxious that there should be no spots on Savitri's sun. The  purpose was also to get important 
issues cleared up in relation to the sort  of poetry Sri Aurobindo as writing and some of his 
disciples aspired to  write. Knowing the spirit and aim of the criticisms Sri Aurobindo welcomed  
them, even asked for them. On many occasions - and these provide most of  the matter collected here - 
he vigorously defended himself, but on several  he willingly agreed to introduce small changes. 
Once he is reported to have  smiled and said: "Is he satisfied now?" Unfortunately, the opportunity 
to  discuss every part of the poem did not arise and we have, therefore, only a  limited number of 
psychological and technical elucidations by him of his  art.<br /><br /> <sup>2</sup> P3 - 4<br /><br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
to spoil my  impressionist symbol<sup>1</sup> or else to revert to the conception of earth as a flat  and immobile surface? I am not 
writing a scientific treatise, I am selecting  certain ideas and impressions to form a symbol of a partial and temporary  darkness of 
the soul and Nature which seems to a temporary feeling of that  which is caught in the Night as if it were universal and eternal. One 
who is  lost in that Night does not think of the other half of the earth as full of  light; to him all is Night and the earth a 
forsaken wanderer in an enduring  darkness. If I sacrifice this impressionism and abandon the image of the  earth wheeling through 
dark space I might as well abandon the symbol  altogether, for this is a necessary part of it. As a matter of fact in the  passage 
itself earth in its wheeling does come into the dawn and pass from  darkness into the light. You must take the idea as a whole and 
in all its  transitions and not press one detail with too literal an insistence. In this  poem I present constantly one partial view of 
life or another temporarily as  if it were the whole in order to give full value to the experience of those  who are bound by that 
view, as for instance, the materialist conception and  experience of life, but if any one charges me with philosophical  inconsistency, 
then it only means that he does not understand the technique  of the Overmind interpretation of life. <br /> ...I come next to the 
passage which you so violently attack, about the  Inconscient waking Ignorance. In the first place, the word "formless" is  indeed 
defective, not so much because of any repetition but because it is  not the right word or idea and I was not myself satisfied with it. 
I have  changed the passage as follows:
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> 
Then something in the  inscrutable darkness stirred; <br /> 
A nameless movement, an unthought Idea <br /> 
Insistent, dissatisfied, without an aim, <br /> 
Something that wished but knew not how to be, <br /> 
Teased the Inconscient to wake Ignorance.<sup>2</sup> </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
But the teasing of the  Inconscient remains and evidently you think that it is bad poetic taste to  tease something so bodiless and 
unreal as the Inconscient. But here several  fundamental issues arise. First of all, are words like Inconscient and  Ignorance 
necessarily an abstract technical jargon? If so, do not words like  consciousness, knowledge etc, undergo the same ban? Is it meant 
that they are

<br />
abstract philosophical  terms and can have no real or concrete meaning, cannot represent things that  one
feels and senses or must often fight as one fights a visible foe? The  Inconscient and the Ignorance may be
mere empty abstractions and can be  dismissed as irrelevant jargon if one has not come into collision with
them  or plunged into their dark and bottomless reality. But to me they are  realities, concrete powers whose
resistance is present everywhere and at all  times in its tremendous and boundless mass. In fact, in writing
this line I  had no intention of teaching philosophy or forcing in an irrelevant  metaphysical idea, although
the idea may be there in implication. I was  presenting a happening that was to me something sensible and, as
one might  say, psychologically and spiritually concrete. The Inconscient comes in  persistently in the
cantos of the First Book of <i>Savitri:</i> e.g.
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> Opponent of that glory of escape, <br />
The black Inconscient swung its dragon tail <br />
Lashing a slumbrous Infinite by its force <br />
Into the deep obscurities of form.<sup>1</sup> </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
There too a  metaphysical idea might be read into or behind the thing seen. But does that  make it technical
jargon or the whole thing an illegitimate mixture? It is  not so to my poetic sense. But you might say,
"It is so to the non-mystical  reader and it Is that reader whom you have to satisfy, as it is for the
general reader that you are writing and not for yourself alone." But if I  had to write for the general
reader I could not have written Savitri at all.  It is in fact for myself that I have written it and for
those who can lend  themselves to the subject-matter, images, technique of mystic poetry. <br /><br /> This is
the real stumbling-block of mystic poetry and specially mystic  poetry of this kind. The mystic feels
real and present, even ever present to  his experience, intimate to his being, truths which to the
ordinary reader  are intellectual abstractions or metaphysical speculations. He is writing of
experiences that are foreign to the ordinary mentality. Either they are  unintelligible to it and in
meeting them it flounders about as if in an  obscure abyss or it takes them as poetic fancies expressed in
intellectually  devised images. That was how a critic in the Hindu condemned such poems as  <i>Nirvana</i>
and <i>Transformation</i>. He said that they were mere intellectual

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
<br />
conceptions and images  and there was nothing of religious feeling or spiritual experience. Yet  Nirvana*
was as close a transcription of a major experience as could be given  in language coined by the human mind
of a realisation in which the mind was  entirely silent and into which no intellectual conception could at
all  enter. One has to use words and images in order to convey to the mind some  perception, some figure of
that which is beyond thought. The critic's  non-understanding was made worse by such a line as:
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>
Only the illimitable Permanent <br />
Is here.
</i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
Evidently he took this  as technical jargon, abstract philosophy. There was no such thing; I felt  with an
overpowering vividness the illimitability or at least something  which could not be described by any other
term and no other description  except the "Permanent" could be made of That which alone existed. To the
mystic there is no such thing as an abstraction. Everything which to the  intellectual mind is abstract
has a concreteness, substantiality which is  more real than the sensible form of an object or of a physical
event. To me,  for instance, consciousness is the very stuff of existence and I can feel it  everywhere
enveloping and penetrating the stone as much as man or the  animal. A movement, a flow of consciousness
is not to me an image but a  fact. If I wrote "His anger climbed against me in a stream", it would be to
the general reader a mere image, not something that was felt by me in a  sensible experience; yet I would
only be describing in exact terms what  actually happened once, a stream of anger, a sensible and violent
current of  it rising up

The mind from thought released, the heart from grief<br />
Grow inexistent now beyond belief;<br />
There is no I, no Nature, known-unknown.<br />

Floats, quivers unreal; forms without relief<br />
Flow, a cinema's vacant shapes; like a reef<br />
Foundering in shoreless gulfs the world is done<br /><br />
Only the illimitable Permanent<br />
Is here. A Peace stupendous, featureless, still<br />

from downstairs and  rushing upon me as I sat in the veranda of the Guest-House, the truth of it  being
confirmed afterwards by the confession of the person who had the  movement. This is only one instance, but
all that is spiritual or  psychological in Savitri is of that character. What is to be done under  these
circumstances? The mystical poet can only describe what he has felt,  seen in himself or others or in the
world just as he has felt or seen it or  experienced through exact vision, close contact or identity and
leave it to  the general reader to understand or not understand or misunderstand  according to his capacity.
A new kind of poetry demands a new mentality in  the recipient as well as in the writer. <br /><br />
Another question is the place of philosophy in poetry or whether it has any  place at all. Some romanticists
seem to believe that the poet has no right  to think at all, only to see and feel. This accusation has been
brought  against me by many that I think too much and that when I try to write in  verse, thought comes in
and keeps out poetry. I hold, to the contrary, that  philosophy has its place and can even take a leading
place along with  psychological experience as it does in the Gita<sup>1</sup>. All depends on how it is
done, whether it is a dry or a living philosophy, an arid intellectual  statement or the expression not
only of the living truth of thought but of  something of its beauty, its light or its power. <br /> <br />

The theory which discourages the poet from thinking or at least from  thinking for the sake of the thought
proceeds from an extreme romanticist  temper, it reaches its acme on one side in the question of the
surrealist,  "Why do you want poetry to mean anything?" and on the other in Housman's  exaltation of pure
poetry which he describes paradoxically as a sort of  sublime nonsense which does not appeal at all to the
mental intelligence but  knocks at the solar plexus and awakes a vital and physical rather than  intellectual
sensation and response. It is of course not that really but a  vividness of imagination and feeling which
disregards the mind's positive  view of things and its logical sequences; the centre or centres it knocks
at  are not the brain-mind, not even the
</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> This dictum about the role of thought  should not be taken as contradicting any implication
of the sentence in an  earlier letter: "Thinking is no longer in my line." What comes from  "overhead"
through the mystic's silent mind, as in Sri Aurobindo's later  poetry can very well assume a philosophical
form. In the presence of  thought-form in poetry that is spoken of here, not the source from which it
ultimately derives or the process by which it enters a poem<br /><br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
<br />
poetic intelligence  but the subtle physical, the nervous, the vital or the psychic centre. The  poem he
quotes from Blake is certainly not nonsense, but it has no positive  and exact meaning for the intellect or
the surface mind, it expresses  certain things that are true and real, not nonsense but a deeper sense
which  we feel powerfully with a great stirring of some inner emotion, but any  attempt at exact intellectual
statement of them sterilises their sense and  spoils their appeal. This is not the method of Savitri.
Its expression aims  at a certain force, directness and spiritual clarity and reality. When it is  not
understood, it is because the truths it expresses are unfamiliar to the  ordinary mind or belong to an
untrodden domain or domains or enter into a  field of occult experience: it is not because there is any
attempt at a dark  or vague profundity or at an escape from thought. The thinking is not  intellectual but
intuitive or more than intuitive, always expressing a  vision, a spiritual contact or a knowledge which
has come by entering into  the thing itself, by identity. <br /> It may be noted that the greater romantic
poets did not shun thought; they  thought abundantly, almost endlessly. They have their characteristic
view of  life, something that one might call their philosophy, their world-view, and  they express it.
Keats was the most romantic of poets, but he could write  "To philosophise I dare not yet"; he did not
write "I am too much of a poet  to philosophise." To philosophise he regarded evidently as mounting on the
admiral's flag-ship and flying an almost royal banner. The philosophy of  Savitri is different but it is
persistently there; it expresses or tries to  express a total and many-sided vision and experience of all
the planes of  being and their action upon each other. Whatever language, whatever terms  are necessary to
convey this truth of vision and experience it uses without  scruple or admitting any mental rule of what
is or is not poetic. It does  not hesitate to employ terms which might be considered as technical when
these can be turned to express something direct, vivid and powerful. That  need not be an introduction of
technical jargon, that is to say, I suppose,  special and artificial language, expressing in this case
only abstract ideas  and generalities without any living truth or reality in them. Such jargon  cannot
make good literature, much less good poetry. But there is a  'poeticism' which establishes a sanitary
cordon against words and ideas  which it considers as prosaic but which properly used can strengthen poetry
and extend its range. That limitation I do not admit as legitimate.

<br />
I have been insisting on these points in view of certain criticisms that  have been made by reviewers and
ethers' - some of them very capable,  suggesting or flatly stating that there was too much thought in my
poems or  that I am even in my poetry a philosopher rather than a poet. I am  justifying a poet's right to
think as well as to see and feel, his right to  "dare to philosophise". I agree with the modernists in their
revolt against  the romanticist's insistence on emotionalism and his objection to thinking  and philosophical
reflection in poetry. But the modernist went too far in  his revolt. In trying to avoid what I may call
poeticism he ceased to be  poetic; wishing to escape from rhetorical writing, rhetorical pretension to
greatness and beauty of style, he threw out true poetic greatness and  beauty, turned from a deliberately
poetic style to a colloquial tone and  even to very flat writing; especially he turned away from poetic
rhythm to a  prose or half-prose rhythm or to no rhythm at all. Also he has weighed too  much on thought
and hastiest the habit of intuitive sight; by turning  emotion out of its intimate chamber in the house of
Poetry, he has had to  bring in to relieve the dryness of much of his thought too much exaggeration  of the
lower vital and sensational reactions untransformed or else  transformed only by exaggeration. Nevertheless
he has perhaps restored to  the poet the freedom to think as well as to adopt a certain  straightforwardness
and directness of style. <br /> <br />

Now I come to the law prohibiting repetition. This rule aims at a certain
kind of intellectual elegance which comes into poetry when the poetic  intelligence and the call for a
refined and classical taste begin to  predominate. It regards poetry as a cultural entertainment and
amusement of  the highly civilised mind; it interests by a faultless art of words, a  constant and ingenious
invention, a sustained novelty of ideas, incidents,  word and phrase. An unfailing variety or the outward
appearance of it is one  of the elegances of this art. But all poetry is not of this kind: its rule  does
not apply to poets like Homer or Valmiki or other early writers. The  Veda might almost be described as a
mass of repetitions: so might the work  of Vaishnava poets and the poetic literature of devotion generally
in India.  Arnold has noted this distinction when speaking of Homer; he mentioned  especially that there is
nothing objectionable in the close repetition of  the same word in the Homeric way of writing. In many things
Homer seems to  make a point of repeating himself. He has stock descriptions, epithets  always reiterated,
lines

even which are constantly repeated again and again when the same Incident  returns in his narrative: e.g.
the line,
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>
Doupesen de peson arabese de teuche' ep' autoi<sup>1</sup>,</i><br />
"Down with a thud he fell and his armour clangoured upon him."
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
He does not hesitate also to repeat the bulk of a line with a variation at the  end, e.g.
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>Be de kat' Oulumpoio karenon choomenos ker.<sup>2</sup></i></blockquote>
</div>

"Down from the peaks  of Olympus he came, wrath vexing his heart-strings" and again, "Down from  the peaks of
Olympus she came impetuously darting." He begins another line  elsewhere with the same word and a similar
action and with the same nature  of a human movement physical and psychological In a scene of Nature, here a
man's silent sorrow listening to the roar of the ocean:
<p/>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">

"Silent he walked by the shore of the many-rumoured ocean."

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
In mystic poetry also  repetition is not objectionable; it is resorted to by many poets, sometimes  with
insistence. I may cite as an example the constant repetition of the  word ham, truth, sometimes eight or
nine times in a short poem of nine or  ten stanzas and often in the same line. This does not weaken the poem,
it  gives it a singular power and beauty. The repetition of the same key ideas,  key images and symbols, key
words or phrases, key epithets, sometimes key  lines or half lines is a constant feature. They give an
atmosphere, a  significant structure, a sort of psychological frame, an architecture. The  object here is
not to amuse or entertain but the self-expression of an inner  truth, a seeing of things and ideas not
familiar to the common mind, a  bringing out of inner experience. It is the true more than the new that the
poet is after. He uses

<br />
<i>avrtti</i>, repetition, as  one of the most powerful means of carrying home what has been thought or
seen and fixing it in the mind in an atmosphere of light and beauty. This  kind of repetition I have used
largely in Savitri. Moreover, the object is  not only to present a secret truth in its true form and true
vision but to  drive it home by the finding of the true word, the true phrase, the mot  justs, the true
image or symbol, if possible the inevitable word; if that is  there, nothing else, repetition included,
matters much. This is natural when  the repetition is intended, serves a purpose; but it can hold even when
the  repetition is not deliberate but comes in naturally in the stream of the  inspiration. I see, therefore,
no objection to the recurrence of the same or  similar image such as sea and ocean, sky and heaven in one
long passage  provided each is the right thing and rightly worded in its place. The same  rule applies to
words, epithets, ideas. It is only if the repetition is  clumsy or awkward, too burdensomely insistent, at
once unneeded and  inexpressive or amounts to a disagreeable and meaningless echo that it must
be rejected. <br /> <br />
...I think there is none of your objections that did not occur to me as  possible from
a certain kind of criticism when I wrote or I re-read what I  had written; but I brushed them aside as
invalid or as irrelevant to the  kind of poem I was writing. So you must not be surprised at my disregard of
them as too slight and unimperative.

What you have written as the general theory of the matter seems to be  correct and it does not differ
substantially from what I wrote. But your  phrase about unpurposive repetition might carry a suggestion which
I would  not be able to accept; it might seem to indicate that the poet must have a  "purpose" in whatever he
writes and must be able to give a logical account  of it to the critical intellect. That is surely not the
way in which the  poet or at least the mystic poet has to do his work. He does not himself  deliberately
choose or arrange word and rhythm but only sees it as it comes  in the very act of inspiration. If there is
any purpose of any kind, it also  comes by and in the process of inspiration. He can criticise himself and
the  work; he can see whether it was a wrong or an Inferior movement, he does not  set 'about correcting it
by any Intellectual method but waits for the true  thing to come in its place.

He cannot always  account to the logical intellect for what he has done: he feels or intuits.  and the reader
or critic has to do the same. <br /> <br />

Thus I cannot tell you for what purpose I admitted the repetition of
the  word "great" in the line about the "great unsatisfied godhead",<sup>1</sup> I only felt  that it was the
one thing to write In that line as "her greatness" was the  only right thing in a preceding line, I also felt
that they did not and  could not clash and that was enough for me. Again, it might be suggested  that the
"high" "warm" subtle ether of love was not only the right  expression but that repetition of these epithets
after they had been used in  describing the atmosphere of Savitri's nature was justified and had a reason
and purpose because it pointed and brought out the identity of the ether of  love with Savitri's atmosphere.
But as a matter of fact I have no such  reason or purpose. It was the identity which brought spontaneously
and  inevitably the use of the same epithets and not any conscious intention  which deliberately used the
repetition for a purpose. <br /> <br />
Your contention that in the lines which I found to be inferior to their
original form and altered back to that form, the inferiority was due to a  repetition is not valid. In the
line about "a vastness like his own"<sup>2</sup> the word "wideness" which had accidentally replaced it
would have been inferior  even if there had been no "wide" or "wideness" anywhere within a hundred  miles
and I would still have altered it back to the original word. So too  with "sealed depths" and
so many others.... These and other alterations were  due to inadvertence and not intentional; repetition or
non-repetition had  nothing to do with the matter. It was the same with "Wisdom nursing Chance":<sup>3</sup>
if "nursing" had been the right word and not a slip replacing the original  phrase I would have kept it
in spite of the word "nurse"; occurring  immediately afterwards: only perhaps I would have taken care to so
arrange  that the repetition of the figure would simply have constituted a two-headed  instead of a
one-headed evil. Yes, I have changed several places where you  objected to repetitions but mostly for other
reasons: I' have kept many  where there was a repetition and changed others where there was no  repetition
at all. I have indeed made modifications or changes where  repetition came at a short distance at the end of
a line; that was because  the place made it too conspicuous. Of course where

the repetition amounts to a mistake, I would have no hesitation in making a  change; for a mistake must
always be acknowledged and corrected.
