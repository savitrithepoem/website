<p class="savitri_text_justified">
Savitri began as a narrative poem of moderate length based on  a legend told in the Mahabharata. 
Sri Aurobindo considered the story to be  originally <span class="standout">"one of the many symbolic 
myths of the Vedic cycle"</span>. Bringing out  its symbolism and charging it progressively with his 
own spiritual vision, he  turned Savitri into the epic it is today. By the  time it was published, 
some passages had gone through dozens of drafts. Sri  Aurobindo explained how he wrote the poem: 
<span class="standout">"I used Savitri as a means of  ascension. I began with it on a certain 
mental level, each time I could reach a  higher level I rewrote from that level... In fact Savitri 
has not been regarded  by me as a poem to be written and finished, but as a field of experimentation 
to  see how far poetry could be written from one's own yogic consciousness and how  that could be made 
creative"</span>. The following  outline of the composition and publication of Savitri draws upon all 
existing  manuscripts and other textual materials, supplemented by the author's letters on  the poem. 
In brief, Savitri took shape through three major phases.<br /><br /> (1) Before 1920, Sri Aurobindo 
made a number of drafts of  a narrative poem retelling in an original way the tale of Savitri and 
Satyavan.  Its last version had a plan of eight books in two parts; the books were not  divided into 
cantos. <br /><br /> (2) In the 1930s, he set about converting this narrative  poem into an epic. 
For a long time he concentrated on the description of  Aswapati's Yoga prior to the birth of Savitri, 
creating by 1945 a new Part One  with three books and many cantos. <br /><br /> (3) In the last phase, 
besides revising Part  One for publication, he reworked and enlarged most of the books written in the  
first period. He added a book on the Yoga of Savitri, making twelve books and  forty-nine cantos in 
all and completing Parts Two and Three.<br /><br /> <b>The Composition of Savitri</b><br /> Sri 
Aurobindo read the Savitri-episode of the Mahabharata in  Sanskrit while he was in Baroda. He 
expressed appreciation of its style in his  'Notes on the Mahabharata', written around 1901. 
But a report that he worked  on an English poem on the subject at this time is not supported 
by his own  statements or any documents that survive. If there was a Baroda Savitri, which  is 
doubtful, it was among the writings of which Sri Aurobindo wrote in 1933,  
<span class="standout">"Most of all that has disappeared into the unknown in the whirlpools and  
turmoil of my political career."</span> Even assuming that such a poem was written in  Baroda, 
for all practical purposes Savitri as we know it was commenced in  Pondicherry. The opening of the 
first known  version is dated 'August 8th 9th / 1916'. Further dates occur later on in the  draft. 
From the death of Satyavan to the end of Savitri's debate with Death, the  manuscript is marked 
every few pages with dates from a three-day period, 17-19  October. After this, the consecutive 
narration breaks off and the notebook  contains only disconnected passages. Some of these are 
sketches for the  conclusion of the poem. Most of them go back over what was already written. They  
represent the beginning of the long process of rewriting which was to continue  until 1950. 
This earliest surviving manuscript of  Savitri shows every sign of being the first draft. It is 
one of the few versions  that Sri Aurobindo dated. But even if precise dates cannot be assigned 
to them,  the manuscripts of the poem can almost always be placed in a definite order  after a 
careful comparison. This is because changes made when one draft was  revised were usually 
incorporated in the next draft, which would then be further  altered and most often expanded. 
Initially the  poem was short enough not to require division into books or cantos. Its sections  
were separated only by blank lines. But soon Sri Aurobindo was dividing it into  'Book I', ending 
with the death of Satyavan, and 'Book II', recounting  Savitri's debate with and victory over Death. 
Next he adopted a scheme of six  cantos and an epilogue. The canto titles were: Love, Fate, Death, 
Night,  Twilight and Day. After making a few drafts in  cantos, he started substituting the 
word 'book' for 'canto'. There were now  six books with the same names as the former cantos. 
Meanwhile the larger  division had reappeared as two parts, 'Earth' and 'Beyond'. At first each  
part comprised three books, not counting the epilogue. But before long, the  rapidly growing first 
book was broken up into two. The second book kept the name  'Love'; the first was renamed 'Quest'. A  
manuscript beginning with 'Book I / Quest' has the title 'Savithr: A Tale and  a Vision'. (In early 
versions, 'Savithr' was the usual spelling of the  heroine's name.) Sri Aurobindo referred to this 
stage in the poem's history in a  letter of 1936: <span class="standout">"Savitri was originally 
written many years ago before the  Mother came [i.e., before the Mother's final arrival in 1920 ], 
as a narrative  poem in two parts, Part I Earth and Part II Beyond... each of four books - or  rather 
Part II consisted of three books and an epilogue."</span> This was the plan of Savitri at the end of 
the first phase of its  composition. But the last manuscript actually completed was in six cantos and 
an  epilogue. After 'books' replaced the 'cantos' and the number of books  increased, some books were 
worked over several times. Others were hardly  touched. There is a partial draft of 'Book III / Death', 
for example; there is  none from the stage when 'Death' would have been the fourth book. 
After 1945  when Sri Aurobindo incorporated material from the early poem into what was by  then a 
full-fledged epic, he sometimes went back to a manuscript of the six  'cantos' as his starting-point. 
Savitri was  apparently put aside during most of the 1920s, a period when Sri Aurobindo did  little 
writing. The first evidence of its resumption is found in a letter of  1931. Here he speaks of a 
radical change in the conception and scope of the  poem. Already the subtitle, 'A Legend and a Symbol', 
is present in his mind:  <span class="standout">"There is a previous draft, the result of the many 
retouchings of which  somebody told you; but in that form it would not have been a 'magnum opus' at  
all. Besides, it would have been a legend and not a symbol. I therefore started  recasting the whole 
thing; only the best passages and lines of the old draft  will remain, altered so as to fit into the 
new frame."</span> Throughout the thirties and early forties, it was primarily Book  One that was 
affected by this recasting. At first this book was still called  'Quest'. It extended as far as 
Savitri's arrival at 'The Destined  Meeting-Place' (the eventual title of Book Five, Canto One). 
But in the early  thirties, the brief description of the Yoga of King Aswapati near the beginning  
swelled to hundreds of lines. What was to become the second and longest book of  the epic, 
'The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds', began to take  shape. In a letter of 1936, Sri Aurobindo  
mentioned a new first book, the 'Book of Birth', carved out of the overgrown  'Quest'. Another 
letter of the same year reveals the internal structure of  this book. 
It was <span class="standout">"divided into sections and the larger sections into  
subsections."</span> Up to this point, the books had been divided only into passages  separated by 
spaces, as many cantos are now. As these sections increased in  length, they were recognised as formal 
units and began to be named and numbered.  Section marks () were usually put before and after the 
numbers. The Book of Birth, whose last section related the birth  and childhood of Savitri, was 
still disproportionately long and was constantly  growing. Early in 1937, Sri Aurobindo expressed 
his intention of rearranging the  opening books into a Book of Beginnings and a Book of Birth and Quest. 
Progress on the poem was intermittent in the thirties due  to Sri Aurobindo's heavy load of 
correspondence. From the end of 1938 to  mid-1940, work on Savitri was suspended. But on 6 September 
1942, a 110-page  draft of the Book of Beginnings was completed. The fourth of its eight sections,  
'The Ascent through the Worlds', accounted for more than half the total length  and had twelve 
subsections. In the next version, this section became Book Two  with the title it now has. The last 
four sections were grouped into Book Three,  'The Book of the Divine Mother'. The second  phase in the 
composition of Savitri reached its culmination when the first three  books were written out in two 
columns on large sheets. Many passages, including  the whole of the first and third books and much of 
the second, went through two  or more drafts in this form. The last complete manuscript is 
dated 'May 7.  1944' at the end. It was while revising this  manuscript that Sri Aurobindo reintroduced 
the word 'canto' which he had not  used since an early stage, applying it to the former 'sections' of 
the books.  At this point the third section of Book One, 'The Yoga of the King', was  turned into 
Cantos 3-5 with their present titles. The three opening books were  for the first time identified 
as 'Part One'.  The two-column manuscript is the last continuous version of Part  One in Sri 
Aurobindo's hand. But he went on reworking Book One and passages  throughout Book Two. For this 
purpose he began using small note-pads whose  sheets, containing new or rewritten matter, could be 
torn out and pinned to the  principal manuscript at the appropriate places.  By the mid-1940s, 
Sri Aurobindo's eyesight was failing and his  handwriting was becoming less and less legible. 
He needed the help of a scribe  in order to put Books 1-3 into a finished form, take up the 
long-neglected later  books, and prepare Savitri for publication. This third phase of its 
composition  saw periods of rapid and decisive progress. But it was to be interrupted the  
month before Sri Aurobindo's passing, a little short of definitive  completion. Much had still 
to be done with the  first part. Sri Aurobindo asked the scribe to read the last version to him.  
After dictating changes, insertions and transpositions, he had his assistant  copy it into a large 
ledger. This copy was meticulously revised before being  given to another disciple for typing. 
The typescript in its turn was read out to  Sri Aurobindo and similarly revised. Heavily 
revised pages were often retyped.  The same process was sometimes repeated, especially in the 
later cantos of Book  Two, where three typed copies exist. Savitri now  began to appear in print, 
though not yet in its final form. The first and third  books were brought out canto by canto from 
August 1946 to February 1948 in  journals connected with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. They were also 
published in  fascicles identical to the journal instalments. The second book was issued in  1947 
and 1948 in two large fascicles. Differences  between the typescripts and the printed texts show 
that proofs of the latter  must have been revised in detail by Sri Aurobindo. Afterwards a copy of 
each  fascicle was read to him. Even at this advanced stage, he made extensive  alterations and 
added new lines and passages.  Meanwhile he had turned his attention to the later books. The plan  
of Parts Two and Three resembled that of the pre-1920 poem, whose books had been  divided into 
'Earth' (Quest, Love, Fate, Death) and 'Beyond' (Night,  Twilight, Day, Epilogue). By 1945, 
however, most of these books had remained  untouched for twenty-five years. Everything written 
under what Sri Aurobindo  termed in 1934 <span class="standout">"the old insufficient 
inspiration"</span> would have to be thoroughly  recast. Moreover, a new book had been 
conceived: The Book of Yoga. Destined to  become one of the longest in the epic, six of its 
seven cantos were still to be  drafted. The material in the Book of Birth and  Quest had for a 
long time been included in Book One. As a result it had gone  through several drafts in the 1930s, 
while other books lay dormant. The last  book to be set aside, it was also the first to be 
taken up again. One manuscript  of it precedes the 1942 draft of the Book of Beginnings. The 
final version was  evidently written within a year or so of this. Since much work had already been  
done on it, this book needed less modification than others. Yet especially in  the first two cantos, 
Sri Aurobindo dictated substantial changes and additions  when he revised the manuscript and 
typescript.  The Book of Love shared to some extent in the good fortune of the  previous book 
during the thirties and early forties. But the last version in Sri  Aurobindo's hand, in the 
notebook which starts with his final manuscript of Book  Four, breaks off in the middle of the 
second canto. The continuation is in the  scribe's hand. It was copied there probably two or 
three years later when the  systematic revision of the later books had been undertaken.  The 
remainder of this notebook contains the scribe's copy of Books  Six, Nine and Ten, reworked 
from the corresponding books in the old poem,  expanded, divided into cantos and renamed 
'The Book of Fate', 'The Book of  Eternal Night' and 'The Book of the Double Twilight'. 
Once Sri Aurobindo had  done enough with Books Four and Five for the time being, it appears 
that he took  up these three books one after the other. After Book Six, he skipped to Book  Nine, 
postponing extensive work on Books Seven and Eight. However, he may have  revised slightly the 
versions of the original third book or canto, 'Death', on  which Book Seven, Canto One and the 
present Book of Death are based.  Drafts of 'Fate', 'Night' and 'Twilight' had been  written on 
one side of loose sheets of paper, like other cantos or books in  several early versions of 
Savitri. This facilitated the complex process of  revision which was now set in motion. When 
the space between lines and in the  margins was filled up, the backs of the pages were available. 
In extreme cases,  whole cantos were written on the reverse sides of the pages with little relation  
to what was on the front. Sri Aurobindo drafted  many passages in small note-pads of the type used 
for Part One. Lines for Books  Five and Nine and large portions of Books Six and Ten were written 
in this way.  Canto Two of Book Six was almost entirely new. The passages drafted for it were  
transferred by the scribe to another note-pad, with changes dictated by Sri  Aurobindo at the time. 
The metamorphosis which  the Book of Fate underwent included the introduction of the Queen: some of  
Aswapati's later speeches in the old version were now given to her, and her long  speech at the 
beginning of Canto Two was composed. Sri Aurobindo worked on this  book in 1946 and brought it 
close to its final form. But he was to return to it  at the end and add significantly to the second 
canto.  An early manuscript of 'Night' was substantially revised and  turned into the two cantos of 
Book Nine. But in this instance Sri Aurobindo  seems to have found the pre-1920 version more adequate 
than usual. He left it  intact to a greater extent than in the case of other books on which he 
bestowed  his full attention in the 1940s. Only the Book of Death and the Epilogue stayed  
closer to their original shape, but he always intended to come back to  these. On the other 
hand, old drafts of  'Twilight' formed merely a starting-point for the four cantos of Book Ten. 
The  speeches of Savitri and Death were refashioned, rearranged in their order, and  new ones 
inserted. As he proceeded from one canto to the next, Sri Aurobindo  added longer and longer 
passages that were quite new. The first section of Canto  One, the long speech of Death which 
ends Canto Two, all but the last few pages  of Canto Three, and most of Canto Four - especially 
its second half, where Savitri  finally triumphs over Death - owe little or nothing to any early 
version.  In a letter of 22 April 1947, Sri Aurobindo summarised  the status of the various books 
of the second and third parts. Books Four, Five,  Six, Nine and Ten had by then 
<span class="standout">"been completed, in a general way, with a  sufficient finality of the 
whole form but subject to final changes in detail"</span>.  The other four books were far from even 
a provisional completion.  A <span class="standout">"drastic recasting of the last two books"</span> 
was felt to  be needed and <span class="standout">"only a part of the eleventh"</span> had been 
subjected to that  process. But a yet larger task lay ahead, the splitting up of the original 
Book  of Death and the writing of the new cantos that would go into the Book of Yoga.  In his 
letter of April 1947 Sri Aurobindo did not say what he planned to do  next. But there are reasons 
to believe that, rather than going on directly from  Book Ten to Book Eleven, he now retraced his 
steps to Book Seven.  The description of Savitri's Yoga, complementing that of  Aswapati's Yoga in 
Part One, was drafted in a thick notebook whose first hundred  pages are filled with drafts for 
Book Ten, Canto Four. By March 1947, even  before finishing the tenth book, Sri Aurobindo had begun 
to use this notebook  for preliminary work on Book Seven. The scribe was not asked to copy the  
semi-legible handwriting of the draft. Instead, Sri Aurobindo dictated to him  the lines he had 
jotted down, often in a somewhat different form. The dictated  version was extensively revised 
before a typed copy was made.   The Book of Yoga had four cantos at first. But the second, 'The  
Parable of the Finding of the Soul', grew to an inordinate length. When the  typescript was 
revised, it was broken up into Cantos 2-5, from 'The Parable of  the Search for the Soul' to 
'The Finding of the Soul'. Revision of the typed  copy was so elaborate in places (as elsewhere, 
especially in Book Six, Canto Two  and in Book Eleven) that sometimes there was not enough room on 
the page. The  scribe would then write on separate slips of paper, attaching as many as ten of  
these to a single page of the typescript. Canto  One of Book Seven has a different background. 
Early in the evolution of Savitri,  the third canto of the poem (later, the third book) was called 
'Death'. It  described the year leading up to Satyavan's death as well as the fatal day  itself. 
The latest version, with the heading 'Book III', is incomplete and  stops before the last day. 
Sri Aurobindo used this manuscript as far as it goes  when he put Book Seven, Canto One into 
its present form.   The second half of an earlier 'Canto III' had to be used as the  manuscript 
for Book Eight. It was revised slightly near the beginning and a  substantial passage was 
dictated at the end. Sri Aurobindo apparently intended  to return to the Book of Death, but this 
was not to be.  On 20 July 1948 he was compelled to admit, <span class="standout">"even Savitri 
has very  much slowed down and I am only making the last revisions of the First Part  already 
completed; the other two parts are just now in cold storage."</span> When the  later parts were 
taken up again, the most important task remaining was evidently  to bring the almost untouched 
eleventh book up to the level of what preceded it.  The old 'Book VII - Day' on which it would be 
based was among the  best-developed portions of the early poem. But after thirty years, 
Sri Aurobindo  had more to say at the climax of Savitri. There  was also the Epilogue; but 
the contemplated revision of this must have seemed  less essential to the total design. 
Although a few pages of an early version  were significantly retouched at some stage, the 
concluding two sections of the  Epilogue stayed almost exactly as they were. Thus the closing pages 
of the epic,  like most of Book Eight, remained as a sample of the style in which Savitri was  
originally written. Near the end of his life, Sri  Aurobindo's eyesight was so poor that he no 
longer wrote at all. He made no more  drafts for Savitri and the work proceeded entirely by 
ictation. Virtually the  whole revision of 'The Book of Everlasting Day' was done in this purely 
oral  manner and may be inferred to belong to this late period. There exist only a few  pages of 
drafts for it in Sri Aurobindo's hand, found in note-pads he used  around 1946. He was probably 
referring to these when he wrote in 1947 that he  had already recast 
<span class="standout">"part of the eleventh"</span> book.  Book Eleven culminates in the longest 
continuous dictated passage  in Savitri. The passage was written by the scribe in a separate note-pad 
and  seems to have no antecedent in any previous draft. This is the section which  begins on p. 702 
with 'Descend to life... ', and ends at the bottom of p. 710  with 'This earthly life become the 
life divine.' Regarding Sri Aurobindo's  dictation in Book Eleven, the scribe reports that 'line 
after line began to  flow from his lips like a smooth and gentle stream and it was on the next day  
that a revision was done to get the link for further continuation.'  By this time, cantos of Parts 
Two and Three were coming  out in journal instalments and fascicles like those of Part One. Most of 
the  cantos of Books Four, Five, Six and Nine were published in this way in 1949-50.  Unlike the 
fascicles of the first part, they were not revised afterwards by Sri  Aurobindo. But in 1948, an 
extract from Book Six,  Canto Two had already been printed in the Sri Aurobindo Mandir Annual. An  
offprint of this was read to Sri Aurobindo and the changes he dictated were  incorporated in a 
retyped copy. The painstaking revision of this second  typescript was reportedly the last work 
he did on Savitri. A short paragraph  before the concluding description of Narad's departure was 
the final passage to  receive detailed attention in November 1950, less than a month before Sri  
Aurobindo's passing. The thirteen-line paragraph was expanded to the seventy-two  lines beginning 
'Queen, strive no more to change the secret will... '<br /><br /> <b>Editions of Savitri</b><br /> 
Sri Aurobindo revised the proofs of the first edition of Part One, making numerous  final changes 
and adding more than a hundred new lines. In 1950, Part One of  Savitri appeared in book form. 
Parts Two and Three could not be similarly  revised. They came out in 1951 in a second volume, 
thus completing the first  edition. The second edition was issued in 1954 in  one volume under 
the imprint of the Sri Aurobindo International University  Centre. Some obvious errors in the 
text of the first edition were emended at  this time. A few of these were evidently due to the 
mishearing of Sri  Aurobindo's dictation. In 1968, the first edition  of Part One was reprinted 
with some new textual corrections. The third complete  edition (1970) contained further emendations. 
Comprising Volumes 28 and 29 of  the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library, it was also brought out 
as a single  volume in a reduced format. This was reprinted a number of times between 1973  and 1990. 
Several typographical and other errors were rectified in the 1976  impression. The fourth, critically 
revised  edition appeared in 1993. This edition was the outcome of a systematic  comparison of the 
printed text of Savitri with the manuscripts. Each line was  traced through all stages of copying, 
typing and printing in which errors could  have occurred. Readings found to have come about through 
inaccurate  transcription or misprinting were corrected. Accidentally omitted lines were  restored to 
the text. This has resulted in a very slight increase in the length  of the poem to its present 
23,837 lines. The 1993  edition has been reprinted several times. In 1997 it was published as 
volumes 33  and 34 of the Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo.  The text of the present, electronic, 
edition (1999) is identical to  the text of the CWSA edition. As the page breaks in the CWSA edition 
are almost  everywhere identical to the page breaks in the SABCL edition, the SABCL page  numbers 
have not been given separately for this book.
