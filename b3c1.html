<td class="td_poem_text" colspan="3"><br /> When it was there, the heart's abyss was filled; <br /> But when the uplifting Deity withdrew, <br /> Existence lost its aim in the Inane. <br /> The order of the immemorial planes, <br /> The godlike fullness of the instruments <br /> Were turned to props for an impermanent scene. <br /> But who that mightiness was he knew not yet. <br /> Impalpable, yet filling all that is, <br /> It made and blotted out a million worlds <br /> And took and lost a thousand shapes and names. <br /> It wore the guise of an indiscernible Vast, <br /> Or was a subtle kernel in the soul: <br /> A distant greatness left it huge and dim, <br /> A mystic closeness shut it sweetly in: <br /> It seemed sometimes a figment or a robe <br /> And seemed sometimes his own colossal shade. <br /> A giant doubt overshadowed his advance. <br /> Across a neutral all-supporting Void <br /> Whose blankness nursed his lone immortal spirit, <br /> Allured towards some recondite Supreme, <br /> Aided, coerced by enigmatic Powers, <br /> Aspiring and half-sinking and upborne, <br /> Invincibly he ascended without pause. <br /> Always a signless vague Immensity <br /> Brooded, without approach, beyond response, <br /> Condemning finite things to nothingness, <br /> Fronting him with the incommensurable. <br /> Then to the ascent there came a mighty term. <br /> A height was reached where nothing made could live, <br /> A line where every hope and search must cease <br /> Neared some intolerant bare Reality, <br /> A zero formed pregnant with boundless change. <br /> On a dizzy verge where all disguises fail <br /> And human mind must abdicate in Light <br /> Or die like a moth in the naked blaze of Truth, <br /> He stood compelled to a tremendous choice. <br /></td>
