Something more might need to be said in regard to the Overhead note in poetry and the Overmind  aesthesis; 
but these are exactly the subjects on which it is difficult to write with any  precision or satisfy the intellect's 
demand for clear and positive statement.<br /> <br />I do not know that it is possible for me to say why I regard one line or 
passage as having  the Overhead touch or the Overhead note while another misses it. When I said that in the  lines about 
the dying man<sup>1</sup> the touch came in through some intense passion and sincerity in  the writer, I was simply 
mentioning the psychological door through which the thing came.  I did not mean to suggest that such passion and sincerity 
could of itself bring in the touch  or that they constituted the Overhead note in the lines. I am afraid I have to say what 
Arnold  said about the grand style; it has to be felt and cannot be explained or accounted for. One has  an intuitive 
feeling, a recognition of something familiar to one's experience or one's deeper  perception in the substance and the 
rhythm or in one or the other which rings out and cannot be  gainsaid. One might put forward a theory or a description 
of what the Overhead character of the line  consists in, but it is doubtful whether any such mentally constructed 
definition could be always  applicable. You speak, for instance, of the sense of the Infinite and the One which is 
pervasive  in the Overhead planes; that need not be explicitly there in the Overhead poetic expression or in  the substance 
of any given line: it can be expressed indeed by Overhead poetry as no other  can express it, but this poetry can deal 
with quite other things. I would certainly say that  Shakespeare's lines</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br /> And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain<sup>2</sup> </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
have the Overhead touch in the substance, the rhythm and the feeling; but Shakespeare is  not giving us here  
the sense of the One and the Infinite. He is, as in the other lines of  his which have this note, dealing as he 
always does with life, with vital emotions and reactions  or the thoughts that spring out in the life-mind under 
the pressure of life. It is not any strict  adhesion to a transcendental view of things that constitutes this kind of 
poetry, but something</p>

behind not belonging to the mind or the vital and physical consciousness and with that a certain  quality or power 
in the language and the rhythm which helps to bring out that deeper something.  If I had to select the line in  
European poetry which most suggests an almost direct descent from the Overmind consciousness  there might come 
first Virgil's line about "the touch of tears in mortal things": </p>

If we could extract and describe the quality and the subtle something that mark the language  and rhythm and 
feeling of these lines and underlie their substance we might attain hazardously  to some mental understanding of the 
nature of Overhead poetry.<br /> <br />The Overmind is not strictly a transcendental consciousness - that epithet would 
more accurately  apply to the supramental and to the Sachchidananda consciousness - though it looks up to the  
transcendental and may receive something from it and though it does transcend the ordinary human  mind and in 
its full and native self-power, when it does not lean down and become part of mind,  is</p>

superconscient to us. It is more properly a cosmic consciousness, even the very base of the  cosmic as we perceive, 
understand or feel it. It stands behind every particular in the cosmos  and is the source of all our mental, vital or 
physical actualities and possibilities which are  diminished and degraded derivations and variations from it and have not, 
except in certain  formations and activities of genius and some intense self-exceeding, anything of the native Overmind 
quality and power. Nevertheless, because  it stands behind as if covered by a veil, something of it can break through 
or shine through or even  only dimly glimmer through and that brings the Overmind touch or note. We cannot get this 
touch  frequently unless we have torn the veil, made a gap in it or rent it largely away and seen the very  face of 
what is beyond, lived in the light of it or established some kind of constant intercourse.  Or we can draw upon it from 
time to time without ever ascending into it if we have established a  line of communication between the higher and the 
ordinary consciousness. What comes down may be very  much diminished but it has something of that. The ordinary reader 
of poetry who has not that experience  will usually not be able to distinguish but would at the most feel that here is 
something extraordinarily  fine, profound, sublime or unusual, - or he might turn away from it as something too high-pitched 
and  excessive; he might even speak depreciatingly of "purple passages", rhetoric, exaggeration or excess.  One who had the 
line of communication open could on the other hand feel what is there and distinguish  even if he could not adequately 
characterise or describe it. The essential character is perhaps that  there is something behind of which I have already 
spoken and which comes not primarily from the mind or  the vital emotion or the physical seeing but from the cosmic 
self and its consciousness standing behind  them all and things then tend to be seen not as the mind or heart or body 
sees them but as this greater  consciousness feels or sees or answers to them. In the direct Overmind transmission this 
something behind  is usually forced to the front or close to the front by a combination of words which carries the 
suggestion  of a deeper meaning or by the force of an image or, most of all, by an intonation and a rhythm which 
carry  up the depths in their wide wash or long march or mounting surge. Sometimes it is left lurking behind and  
only suggested so that a subtle feeling of what is not actually expressed is needed if the reader is not  to miss it. 
This is oftenest the case when there is just a touch or note pressed upon</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">

<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
something that  would be otherwise only of a mental, vital or physical poetic value and nothing of the body of the  
Overhead power shows itself through the veil, but at most a tremor and vibration, a gleam or a glimpse.  In 
the lines I have chosen there is always an unusual quality in the rhythm, as prominently in Virgil's  line, 
often in the very building and constantly in the intonation and the association of the sounds which  meet in the 
line and find themselves linked together by a sort of inevitable felicity. There is also an  inspired selection 
or an unusual bringing together of words which has the power to force a deeper sense  on the mind as in Virgil's</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px"><i> Sunt lacrimae rerum. </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
One can note that this line if translated straight into English would sound awkward and clumsy  as would many of the finest 
lines in Rig Veda; that is precisely because they are new and felicitous  turns in the original language, discoveries of 
an unexpected and absolute phrase; they defy  translation. If you note the combination of words and sounds in Shakespeare's line</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
so arranged as to force on the mind and still more on the subtle nerves and sense the utter  absoluteness of the 
difficulty and pain of living for the soul that has awakened to the misery  of the world, you can see how this 
technique works. Here and elsewhere the very body and soul of  the thing seen or felt come out into the open. 
The same dominant characteristic can be found in  other lines which I have not cited, - in Leopardi's</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> Insano indegno mistero delle cose<sup>1</sup><br /> 
(The insane and ignoble mystery of things) </i></div>

<i> Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone.<sup>1</sup> </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
Milton's line lives by its choice of the word "wander" to collocate with "through eternity"; if he had  chosen any 
other word, it would no longer have been an Overhead line, even if the surface sense had  been exactly the same. On the other 
hand, take Shelley's stanza -</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> We look before and after,<br /> 
And pine for what is not:<br /> 
Our sincerest laughter<br /> 
With some pain is fraught;<br /> 
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.<sup>2</sup> </i><</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
This is perfect poetry with the most exquisite melody and beauty of wording and an unsurpassable  poignancy of 
pathos, but there is no touch or note of the Overhead inspiration: it is the mind and  the heart, the vital 
emotion, working at their highest pitch under the stress of a psychic inspiration.  The rhythm is of the same 
character, a direct, straightforward, lucid and lucent movement welling out limpidly straight from the psychic 
source. The same characteristics  are found in another short lyric of Shelley's which is perhaps the purest example 
of the psychic  inspiration in English poetry:</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px"><i> 
I can give not what men call love;<br /> 
But wilt thou accept not<br /> 
The worship the heart lifts above<br /> 
And the Heavens reject not, -<br /><br /> 
The desire of the moth for the star,<br /> 
Of the night for the morrow,<br /> 
The devotion to something afar<br /> 
From the sphere of our sorrow?<sup>3</sup><br /> </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
We have again extreme poetic beauty there, but nothing of the Overhead note.<br /> <br />In the other lines I have cited 
it is really the Overmind  language and rhythm that have been to some extent transmitted; but of course all 
Overhead poetry  is not from the Overmind, more</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
often it comes from the Higher Thought, the Illumined Mind or the  pure Intuition. This last is different 
from the mental intuition which is frequent enough in poetry  that does not transcend the mental level. 
The language and rhythm from these other Overhead levels   can be very different from that which is proper 
to the Overmind; for the Overmind thinks in a mass;   its thought, feeling, vision is high or deep or 
wide or all these things together: to use the Vedic   expression about fire, the divine messenger, it 
goes vast on its way to bring the divine riches, and   it has a corresponding language and rhythm. The 
Higher Thought has a strong tread often with bare   unsandalled feet and moves in a clear-cut light: a 
divine power, measure, dignity is its most frequent   character. The outflow of the Illumined Mind comes 
in a flood brilliant with revealing words or a light of   crowding images, sometimes surcharged with its 
burden of revelations, sometimes with a luminous sweep.   The Intuition is usually a lightning flash showing 
up a single spot or plot of ground or scene with an   entire and miraculous completeness of vision to the 
surprised ecstasy of the inner eye; its rhythm has   a decisive inevitable sound which leaves nothing essential 
unheard, but very commonly is embodied in a   single stroke. These, however, are only general or dominant 
characters; any number of variations is   possible. There are besides mingled inspirations, several levels 
meeting and combining or modifying   each other's notes, and an Overmind transmission can contain or 
bring with it all the rest, but how much of this description will be to the ordinary reader of poetry at  
all intelligible or clearly identifiable?<br /> <br /> There are besides in mental poetry derivations or substitutes  
for all these styles. Milton's "grand style" is such a substitute for the manner of the Higher  Thought. 
Take it anywhere at its ordinary level or in its higher elevation, there is always or  almost always that echo there:</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit<br /> 
Of that forbidden tree<sup>1</sup> </i></div>

<i> Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides,<br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
Shakespeare's poetry coruscates with a play of the hues of imagination which we may regard as a  mental substitute 
for the inspiration of the Illumined Mind and sometimes by aiming at an exalted  note he links on to the 
illumined Overhead inspiration itself as in the lines I have more than once  quoted:</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast<br /> 
Seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains<br /> 
In cradle of the rude imperious surge?<sup>2</sup><br /> </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
But the rest of that passage falls away in spite of its high-pitched language and resonant  rhythm far below the 
Overhead strain. So it is easy for the mind to mistake and take the higher  for the lower inspiration or 
vice versa. Thus Milton's lines might at first sight be taken because of  a certain depth of emotion in their 
large lingering rhythm as having the Overhead complexion, but this  rhythm loses something of its sovereign 
right because there are no depths of sense behind it. It conveys  nothing but the noble and dignified pathos of 
the blindness and old age of a great personality fallen into  evil days. Milton's architecture of thought and verse 
is high and powerful and massive, but there are  usually no subtle echoes there, no deep chambers : the occult 
things in man's being are foreign to his  intelligence, - for it is in the light of the poetic intelligence that 
he works. He does not stray into  "the mystic cavern of the heart", does not follow the inner fire entering like a 
thief with the  Cow of Light into the secrecy of secrecies. Shakespeare does sometimes get in as if by a 
splendid  psychic accident in spite of his preoccupation with the colours and shows of life.<br /> <br /> I do not 
know therefore whether I can speak with any certainty  about the lines you quote; I would perhaps have to read 
them in their context first, but it seems to  me that there is just a touch, as in the lines about the dying man. 
The thing that is described there  may have happened often enough in times like those of the recent</p>

wars and upheavals and in times of  violent strife and persecution and catastrophe, but the greatness of the 
experience does not come out  or not wholly, because men feel with the mind and heart and not with the soul; 
but here there is by  some accident of wording and rhythm a suggestion of something behind, of the greatness 
of the soul's  experience and its courageous acceptance of the tragic, the final, the fatal—and its resistance; 
it is  only just a suggestion, but it is enough: the Overhead has touched and passed back to its heights.   
There is something very different but of the same essential calibre in the line you quote:</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px"><i> Sad eyes watch for feet that never come. </i></div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
It is still more difficult to say anything very tangible about the Overmind aesthesis. When  I wrote about it 
I was thinking of the static aesthesis that perceives and receives rather than  of the dynamic aesthesis which 
creates; I was not thinking at all of superior or inferior grades of  poetic greatness or beauty. If the complete 
Overmind power or even that of the lower Overhead planes  could come down into the mind and entirely transform 
its action, then no doubt there might be greater  poetry written than any that man has yet achieved, just as a 
greater superhuman life might be created   if the Supermind could come down wholly into life and lift life wholly 
into itself and transform it.   But what happens at present is that something comes down and accepts to work under 
the law of the mind   and with a mixture of the mind and it must be judged by the laws and standards of the mind. 
It brings in   new tones, new colours, new elements, but it does not change radically as yet the stuff of the   
consciousness with which we labour.<br /> <br />
Whether it produces great poetry or not depends on the extent to 
which it manifests its  power and overrides rather than serves the mentality  which it is helping. At present it 
does not do that sufficien'tly to raise the work to the full  greatness of the worker.<br /> <br />And then what do you 
mean exactly by greatness in poetry ? One can  say that Virgil is greater than Catullus and that many of Virgil's 
lines are greater than anything  Catullus ever achieved. But poetical perfection is not the same thing as 
poetical greatness. Virgil is  perfect at his best, but Catullus too is perfect at his best: even each has a 
certain exquisiteness of  perfection, each in his own kind. Virgil's kind is large and deep, that of Catullus sweet and</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 816<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
intense. Virgil's art reached or had from its beginning a greater and more constant ripeness than that of Catullus.  
We can say then that Virgil was a greater poet and artist of word and rhythm but we cannot say that his  poetry, at 
his best, was more perfect poetry and that of Catullus less perfect. That renders futile  many of the attempts at 
comparison like Arnold's comparison of Wordsworth's Skylark with Shelley's.  You may say that Milton was a greater 
poet than Blake, but there can always be people, not aesthetically  insensitive, who would prefer Blake's 
lyrical work to Milton's grander achievement, and there are  certainly things in Blake which touch deeper 
chords than the massive hand of Milton could ever reach.  So all poetic superiority is not summed up in the 
word greatness. Each kind has its own best which  escapes from comparison and stands apart in its own value.<br /> <br />
Let us then leave for the present the question of poetic greatness  or superiority aside and come back to the Overmind 
aesthesis. By aesthesis is meant a reaction of the  consciousness, mental and vital and even bodily, which receives a 
certain element in things, something  that can be called their taste, Rasa, which, passing through the mind or sense or 
both, awakes a vital  enjoyment of the taste, Bhoga, and this can again awaken us, awaken even the soul in us to something 
yet  deeper and more fundamental than mere pleasure and enjoyment, to some form of the spirit's delight of  existence, 
Ananda. Poetry, like all art, serves the seeking for these things, this aesthesis, this Rasa,  Bhoga, Ananda; 
it brings us a Rasa of word and sound but also of the idea and, through the idea, of the  things expressed by the 
word and sound and thought, a mental or vital or sometimes the spiritual image  of their form, quality, 
impact upon us or even, if the poet is strong enough, of their world-essence,  their cosmic reality, the very 
soul of them, the spirit that resides in them as it resides in all things.  Poetry may do more than this, but this 
at least it must do to however small an extent or it is not poetry.  Aesthesis therefore is of the very essence of 
poetry, as it is of all art. But it is not the sole element   and aesthesis too is not confined to a reception of 
poetry and art; it extends to everything, in the world: there is nothing we can sense, think or in any way 
experience to which there cannot be an  aesthetic reaction of our conscious being. Ordinarily, we suppose that 
aesthesis is concerned with beauty,  and that indeed is its most prominent concern: but it is concerned with 
many other things also. It is  the universal Ananda</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 817<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
that is the parent of aesthesis and the universal Ananda takes three major and original forms, beauty, love and 
delight, the delight of all existence, the delight in things, in all things. Universal Ananda is the artist and 
creator of the universe witnessing, experiencing and taking joy in its creation. In the lower consciousness it 
creates its opposites, the sense of ugliness as well as the sense of beauty, hate and repulsion and dislike as 
well as love and attraction and liking, grief and pain as well as joy and delight; and between these dualities or 
as a grey tint in the background there is a general tone of neutrality and indifference born from the universal 
insensibility into which the Ananda sinks in its dark negation in the Inconscicnt. All this is the sphere of 
aesthesis, its dullest reaction is indifference, its highest is ecstasy. Ecstasy is a sign of a return towards 
the original or supreme Ananda: that art or poetry is supreme which can bring us something of the supreme tone 
of ecstasy. For as the consciousness sinks from the supreme levels through various degrees towards the Inconscience 
the general sign of this descent is an always diminishing power of its intensity, intensity of being, intensity of 
consciousness, intensity offeree, intensity of the delight in things and the delight of existence. So too as we 
ascend towards the supreme level, these intensities increase. As we climb beyond Mind, higher and wider values 
replace the values of our limited mind, life and bodily consciousness. Aesthesis shares in this intensification of 
capacity. The capacity for pleasure and pain, for liking and disliking is comparatively poor on the level of our 
mind and life; our capacity for ecstasy is brief and limited; these tones arise from a general ground of neutrality 
which is always dragging them back towards itself. As it enters the Overhead planes the ordinary aesthesis turns 
into a pure delight and becomes capable of a high, a large or a deep abiding ecstasy. The ground is no longer 
a general neutrality, but a pure spiritual ease and happiness upon which the special tones of the aesthetic 
consciousness come out or from which they arise. This is the first fundamental change.<br /> <br />Another change 
in this transition is a turn towards universality in  place of the isolations, the conflicting generalities, 
the mutually opposing dualities of the lower  consciousness. In the Overmind we have a first firm foundation 
of the experience of a universal beauty,  a universal love, a universal delight. These things can come on 
the mental and vital plane even before those planes are directly touched or influenced by the spiritual 
consciousness;  but they are there</p>

a temporary experience and not permanent or they are limited in their field and  do not touch the whole being. 
They are a glimpse and not a change of vision or a change of nature.  The artist for instance can look at 
things only plain or shabby or ugly or even repulsive to the ordinary  sense and see in them and bring out 
of them beauty and the delight that goes with beauty. But this is a  sort of special grace for the artistic 
consciousness and is limited within the field of his art. In the  Overhead consciousness, especially in the 
Overmind, these things become more and more the law of the vision  and the law of the nature. Wherever the 
Overmind spiritual man turns he sees a universal beauty touching  and uplifting all things, expressing itself 
through them, moulding them into a field or objects of its  divine aesthesis; a universal love goes out from 
him to all beings; he feels the Bliss which has created  the worlds and upholds them and all that is expresses 
to him the universal delight, is made of it, is a  manifestation of it and moulded into its image. 
This universal aesthesis of beauty and delight does not  ignore or fail to understand the differences 
and oppositions, the gradations, the harmony and disharmony  obvious to the ordinary consciousness; but, 
first of all, it draws a Rasa from them and with that comes  the enjoyment, Bhoga, and the touch or the mass of 
the Ananda. It sees that all things have their meaning,  their value, their deeper or total significance which 
the mind does not see, for the mind is only concerned  with a surface vision, surface contacts and its own surface 
reactions. When something expresses perfectly  what it was meant to express, the completeness brings with it a 
sense of harmony, a sense of artistic  perfection; it gives even to what is discordant a place in a system of 
cosmic concordances and the discords  become part of a vast harmony, and wherever there is harmony, there is a 
sense of beauty. Even in form itself,  apart from the significance, the Overmind consciousness sees the object 
with a totality which changes its  effect on the percipient even while it remains the same thing. It sees 
lines and masses and an underlying  design which the physical eye does not see and which escapes even the 
keenest mental vision. Every form  becomes beautiful to it in a deeper and larger sense of beauty than that 
commonly known to us. The Overmind  looks also straight at and into the soul of each thing and not only at its 
form or its significance to the  mind or to the life; this brings to it not only the true truth of the thing 
but the delight of it. It sees  also the one spirit in all, the face of the Divine everywhere</p>

and there can be no greater Ananda than that;  it feels oneness with all, sympathy, love, the bliss of the 
Brahman. In a highest, a most  integral experience it sees all things as if made of existence, consciousness, 
power,  bliss, every atom of them charged with and constituted of Sachchidananda. In all this  the Overmind 
aesthesis takes its share and gives its response; for these things come  not merely as an idea in the mind or 
a truth-seeing but as an experience of the whole  being and a total response is not only possible but above a 
certain level imperative.<br /><br /> I have said that aesthesis responds not only to what  we call beauty and beautiful 
things but to all things. We make a distinction between  truth and beauty; but there can be an aesthetic response 
to truth also, a joy in its  beauty, a love created by its charm, a rapture in the finding, a passion in the embrace,  
an aesthetic joy in its expression, a satisfaction of love in the giving of it to others.  Truth is not merely a dry 
statement of facts or ideas to or by the intellect; it can be a  splendid discovery, a rapturous revelation, a thing 
of beauty that is a joy for ever. The  poet also can be a seeker and lover of truth as well as a seeker and 
lover of beauty.  He can feel a poetic and aesthetic joy in the expression of the true as well as in the  
expression of the beautiful. He does not make a mere intellectual or philosophical  statement of the truth; 
it is his vision of its beauty, its power, his thrilled  reception of it, his joy in it that he tries to convey 
by an utmost perfection in  word and rhythm. If he has the passion, then even a philosophical statement of it he  
can surcharge with this sense of power, force, light, beauty. On certain levels of the  Overmind, where the mind 
element predominates over the element of gnosis, the  distinction between truth and beauty is still valid. It is 
indeed one of the chief  functions of the Overmind to separate the main powers of the consciousness and give  to 
each its full separate development and satisfaction, bring out its utmost potency  and meaning, its own soul and 
significant body and take it on its own way as far as  it can go. It can take up each power of man and give it its 
full potentiality, its  highest characteristic development. It can give to intellect its austerest  intellectuality 
and to logic its most sheer unsparing logicality. It can give to  beauty its most splendid passion of luminous form 
and the consciousness that receives  it a supreme height and depth of ecstasy. It can create a sheer and pure poetry  
impossible for the intellect to sound to its depths or wholly grasp, much less to</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">

<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
mentalise and analyse. It is the function of Overmind to give to every possibility  its full potential, its own 
separate kingdom. But also there is another action of  Overmind which sees and thinks and creates in masses, which 
reunites separated things,  which reconciles opposites. On that level truth and beauty not only become constant  
companions but become one, involved in each other, inseparable: on that level the true  is always beautiful and 
the beautiful is always true. Their highest fusion perhaps only takes place in the Supermind; but Overmind on its 
summits draws enough  of the supramental light to see what the Supermind sees and do what the Supermind does though 
in a lower  key and with a less absolute truth and power. On an inferior level Overmind may use the language of 
the  intellect to convey as far as that language can do it its own greater meaning and message but on its  summits 
Overmind uses its own native language and gives to its truths their own supreme utterance,  and no intellectual 
speech, no mentalised poetry can equal or even come near to that power and beauty.  Here your intellectual dictum 
that poetry lives by its aesthetic quality alone and has no need of truth  or that truth must depend upon aesthetics 
to become poetic at all, has no longer any meaning. For there  truth itself is highest poetry and has only to appear 
to be utterly beautiful to the vision, the hearing,  the sensibility of the soul. There dwells and from there springs 
the mystery of the inevitable word,  the supreme immortal rhythm, the absolute significance and the absolute utterance.<br /> <br />
I hope you do not feel crushed under this avalanche of  metaphysical psychology; you have called it upon yourself by your 
questioning about the Overmind's  greater, larger and deeper aesthesis. What I have written is indeed very scanty and 
sketchy, only  some of the few essential things that have to be said; but without it I could not try to give you any  
glimpse of the meaning of my phrase. This greater aesthesis is inseparable from the greater truth,  it is deeper because 
of the depth of that truth, larger by all its immense largeness. I do not expect  the reader of poetry to come anywhere 
near to all that, he could not without being a Yogi or at least  a sadhak: but just as the Overhead poetry brings some 
touch of a deeper power of vision and creation  into the mind without belonging itself wholly to the higher reaches, 
so also the full appreciation of  all its burden needs at least some touch of a deeper response of the mind and some 
touch of a deeper  aesthesis. Until that becomes</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
general the Overhead or at least the Overmind is not going to do more  than to touch here and there, as it did in the 
past, a few lines, a few passages, or perhaps as things  advance, a little more, nor is it likely to pour into our 
utterance its own complete power and absolute  value.<br /><br /> I have said that Overhead poetry is not necessarily 
greater  or more perfect than any other kind of poetry. But perhaps a subtle qualification may be made to  this 
statement. It is true that each kind of poetical writing can reach a highest or perfect  perfection in its own line 
and in its own quality and what can be more perfect than a perfect  perfection or can we say that one kind of absolute 
perfection is "greater" than another kind? What can be more absolute than the absolute? But then what do we mean by the 
perfection of poetry?  There is the perfection of the language and there is the perfection of the word-music and the rhythm,  
beauty of speech and beauty of sound, but there is also the quality of the thing said which counts  for something. 
If we consider only word and sound and what in themselves they evoke, we arrive at the  application of the theory 
of art for art's sake to poetry. On that ground we might say that a lyric of  Anacreon is as good poetry and as perfect 
poetry as anything in Aeschylus or Sophocles or Homer.  The question of the elevation or depth or intrinsic beauty 
of the thing said cannot then enter into  our consideration of poetry; and yet it does enter, with most of us at any 
rate, and is part of the  aesthetic reaction even in the most "aesthetic" of critics and readers. From this point of 
view the  elevation from which the inspiration comes may after all matter, provided the one who receives it is  a fit 
and powerful instrument; for a great poet will do more with a lower level of the origin of  inspiration than a smaller 
poet can do even when helped from the highest sources. In a certain sense  all genius comes from Overhead; for genius 
is the entry or inrush of a greater consciousness into the  mind or a possession of the mind by a greater power. 
Every operation of genius has at its back or  infused within it an intuition, a revelation, an inspiration, an 
illumination or at the least a hint  or touch or influx from some greater power or level of conscious being 
than those which men ordinarily  possess or use. But this power has two ways of acting: in one it touches 
the ordinary modes of mind  and deepens, heightens, intensifies or exquisitely refines their action but 
without changing its  modes or transforming its normal character; in the other it brings down into</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 823<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
these normal modes  something of itself, something supernormal, something which one at once feels to be 
extraordinary  and suggestive of a superhuman level. These two ways of action when working in poetry 
may produce  things equally exquisite and beautiful, but the word "greater" may perhaps be applied, with 
the  necessary qualifications, to the second way and its too rare poetic creation.<br /><br /> The great bulk of 
the highest poetry belongs to the first of  these two orders. In the second order there are again two or 
perhaps three levels; sometimes a  felicitous turn or an unusual force of language or a deeper note of 
feeling brings in the Overhead  touch. More often it is the power of the rhythm that lifts up language that 
is simple and common or a  feeling or idea that has often been expressed and awakes something which is not 
ordinarily there. If  one listens with the mind only or from the vital centre only, one may have a wondering 
admiration for  the skill and beauty of woven word and sound or be struck by the happy way or the power with 
which the feeling or idea is expressed. But there is something more in it than that; it is this  that a deeper, 
more inward strand of the consciousness has seen and is speaking, and if we listen  more profoundly we can get 
something more than the admiration and delight of the mind or Housman's  thrill of the solar plexus. We can feel 
perhaps the Spirit of the universe lending its own depth to  our mortal speech or listening from behind to some 
expression of itself, listening perhaps to its  memories of</p>

There is a second level on which the poetry draws into itself a fuller language of intuitive  inspiration, 
illumination or the higher thinking and feeling. A very rich or great poetry may then  emerge and many of 
the most powerful passages in Shakespeare, Virgil or Lucretius or the Mahabharata  and Ramayana, not to 
speak of the Gita, the Upanishads or the Rig Veda, have this inspiration. It is a  poetry "thick inlaid 
with patines of bright gold" or welling up in a stream of passion, beauty  and force. But sometimes there 
comes down a supreme voice, the Overmind voice and the Overmind  music and it is to be observed that the 
lines and passages where that happens rank among the  greatest and most admired in all poetic literature. 
It would be therefore too much to say that  the Overhead inspiration cannot bring in a greatness into 
poetry which could surpass the other levels of inspiration, greater even from the purely aesthetic point 
of view and certainly greater  in the power of its substance.<br /><br /> A conscious attempt to write Overhead 
poetry with a mind aware of the planes from which this inspiration  comes and seeking always to ascend to 
those levels or bring down something from them, would probably result  in a partial success; at its lowest 
it might attain to what I have called the first order, ordinarily it  would achieve the two lower levels of 
the second order and in its supreme moments it might in lines and in  sustained passages achieve the 
supreme level, something of the highest summit of its potency. But its  greatest work will be to express 
adequately and constantly what is now only occasionally and inadequately  some kind of utterance of the 
things above, the things beyond, the things behind the apparent world and  its external or superficial 
happenings and phenomena. It would not only bring in the occult in its larger  and deeper ranges but the 
truths of the spiritual heights, the spiritual</p>

depths, the spiritual intimacies  and vastnesses as also the truths of the inner mind, the inner 
life, an inner or subtle physical beauty  and reality. It would bring in the concreteness, 
the authentic image, the inmost soul of identity and the  heart of meaning of these things, 
so that it could never lack in beauty. If this could be achieved by one  possessed, if not of a 
supreme, still of a sufficiently high and wide poetic genius, something new could  be added to the 
domain of poetry and there would be no danger of the power of poetry beginning to fade, to  fall 
into decadence, to fail us. It might even enter into the domain of the infinite and inexhaustible,  
catch some word of the Ineffable, show us revealing images which bring us near to the Reality that is 
secret  in us and in all, of which the Upanishad speaks,</p>

The gods of the Overhead planes can do much to bridge that distance  and to bring out that closeness, 
even if they cannot altogether overtake the Reality that exceeds and  transcends them.</p>
