<td class="td_poem_text" colspan="3"><br /> We shall shed the discredit of our mortal state, <br /> Make the abysm a road for Heaven's descent, <br /> Acquaint our depths with the supernal Ray <br /> And cleave the darkness with the mystic Fire.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adventuring once more in the natal mist <br /> Across the dangerous haze, the pregnant stir, <br /> He through the astral chaos shore a way <br /> Mid the grey faces of its demon gods, <br /> Questioned by whispers of its flickering ghosts, <br /> Besieged by sorceries of its fluent force. <br /> As one who walks unguided through strange fields <br /> Tending he knows not where nor with what hope, <br /> He trod a soil that failed beneath his feet <br /> And journeyed in stone strength to a fugitive end. <br /> His trail behind him was a vanishing line <br /> Of glimmering points in a vague immensity; <br /> A bodiless murmur travelled at his side <br /> In the wounded gloom complaining against light. <br /> A huge obstruction its immobile heart, <br /> The watching opacity multiplied as he moved <br /> Its hostile mass of dead and staring eyes; <br /> The darkness glimmered like a dying torch. <br /> Around him an extinguished phantom glow <br /> Peopled with shadowy and misleading shapes <br /> The vague Inconscient's dark and measureless cave. <br /> His only sunlight was his spirit's flame. <br /></td>
