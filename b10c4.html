<td class="td_poem_text" colspan="3"><br /> But where is thy strength to conquer Time and Death? <br /> Hast thou God's force to build heaven's values here? <br /> For truth and knowledge are an idle gleam <br /> If Knowledge brings not power to change the world, <br /> If Might comes not to give to Truth her right. <br /> A blind Force, not Truth has made this ignorant world, <br /> A blind Force, not Truth orders the lives of men: <br /> By Power, not Light, the great Gods rule the world; <br /> Power is the arm of God, the seal of Fate. <br /> O human claimant to immortality, <br /> Reveal thy power, lay bare thy spirit's force, <br /> Then will I give back to thee Satyavan. <br /> Or if the Mighty Mother is with thee, <br /> Show me her face that I may worship her; <br /> Let deathless eyes look into the eyes of Death, <br /> An imperishable Force touching brute things <br /> Transform earth's death into immortal life. <br /> Then can thy dead return to thee and live. <br /> The prostrate earth perhaps shall lift her gaze <br /> And feel near her the secret body of God <br /> And love and joy overtake fleeing Time."<br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Savitri looked on Death and answered not. <br /> Almost it seemed as if in his symbol shape <br /> The world's darkness had consented to Heaven-light <br /> And God needed no more the Inconscient's screen. <br /> A mighty transformation came on her. <br /> A halo of the indwelling Deity, <br /> The Immortal's lustre that had lit her face <br /> And tented its radiance in her body's house, <br /> Overflowing made the air a luminous sea. <br /> In a flaming moment of apocalypse <br /> The Incarnation thrust aside its veil. <br /> A little figure in infinity <br /> Yet stood and seemed the Eternal's very house, <br /> As if the world's centre was her very soul <br /></td>
