You have asked me to comment on your friend X's comments on my poetry and especially on  
<i>Savitri</i>.<sup>1</sup> But, first of all, it is not usual for a poet to criticise the  
criticisms of his critics though a few perhaps have done so; the poet writes for his own  
satisfaction, his own delight in poetical creation or to express himself and he leaves his  
work for the world, and rather for posterity than for the contemporary world, to recognise  
or to ignore, to judge and value according to its perception or its pleasure. As for the  
contemporary world he might be said rather to throw his poem in its face and leave it to  
resent this treatment as an unpleasant slap, as a contemporary world treated the early poems  
of Wordsworth and Keats, or to accept it as an abrupt but gratifying attention, which was  
ordinarily the good fortune of the great poets in ancient Athens and Rome and of poets like  
Shakespeare and Tennyson in modern times. Posterity does not always confirm the contemporary  
verdict, very often it reverses it, forgets or depreciates the writer enthroned by contemporary  
fame, or raises up to a great height work little appreciated or quite ignored in its own time.  
The only safety for the poet is to go his own way careless of the blows and caresses of the  
critics; it is not his business to answer them. Then you ask me to right the wrong turn your  
friend's critical mind has taken; but how is it to be determined what is the right and what  
is the wrong turn, since a critical judgment depends usually on a personal reaction determined  
by the critic's temperament or the aesthetic trend in him or by values, rules or canons which  
are settled for his intellect and agree with the viewpoint from which his mind receives whatever  
comes to him for judgment; it is that which is right for him though it may seem wrong to a  different 
temperament, aesthetic intellectuality or mental viewpoint. Your friend's judgments,  according to 
his own account of them, seem to be determined by a sensitive temperament  finely balanced in its 
own poise but limited in its appreciations, clear and open to some  kinds of poetic creation,</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> The critic's comments were made apropos of the article "Sri Aurobindo - A New Age  
of Mystical Poetry", by K.D. Sethna (Sri Aurobindo Circle, 1946). Passages from Savitri  appeared 
in print for the first time in this article, in which a few of Sri Aurobindo's  shorter poems 
were also discussed. The full text of Sri Aurobindo's letter, from which  relevant portions are 
quoted here, is to be found in On Himself, Sri Aurobindo Birth  Centenary Library, 
Vol 26, pp. 238-63.<br /><br />

<br />
reserved towards others, against yet others closed and cold or excessively depreciative.   
This sufficiently explains his very different reactions to the two poems, Descent   
and Flame-Wind,<sup>1</sup> which he unreservedly admires and to Savitri. However, 
since you   have asked me, I will answer, as between ourselves, in some detail and put 
forward   my own comments on his comments and my own judgments on his judgments. 
It may be   rather long; for if such things are done, they may as well be clearly and 
thoroughly done.   I may also have something to say about the nature and intention of my 
poem and the technique   necessitated by the novelty of the intention and nature.<br /> <br />
Let me deal first with some of the details he stresses so as to get them out of the way.   
His detailed intellectual reasons for his judgments seem to me to be often arbitrary   
and fastidious, sometimes based on a misunderstanding and therefore invalid or else valid   
perhaps in other fields but here inapplicable. Take, for instance, his attack upon my use   
of the prepositional phrase. Here, it seems to me, he has fallen victim to a grammatical   
obsession and lumped together under the head of the prepositional twist a number of different   
turns some of which do not belong to that category at all. In the line,<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> Lone on my summits of calm I have brooded with voices around me<br /> </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
there is no such twist; for I did not mean at all "on my calm summits", but intended  
straightforwardly to convey the natural, simple meaning of the word. If I write "the fields  of beauty" 
or "walking on the paths of truth" I do not expect to be supposed to mean "in  beautiful fields" or 
"in truthful paths"; it is the same with "summits of calm", I mean  "summits of calm" and nothing else; 
it is a phrase like "He rose to high peaks of vision"  or "He took his station on the highest summits of knowledge". 
The calm is the calm of the  highest spiritual consciousness to which the soul has ascended, making those summits its  
own and looking down from their highest heights on all below: in spiritual experience,  in the occult

and translations referred to in this letter were previously publised in Collected  Poems and Plays

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
vision or feeling that accompanies it, this calm is not felt as an abstract quality or a mental  
condition but as something concrete and massive, a self-existent reality to which one reaches,  
so that the soul standing on its peak is rather a tangible fact of experience than a poetical  
image. Then there is the phrase "A face of rapturous calm"<sup>1</sup>: he seems to think it is 
a mere  trick of language, a substitution of a prepositional phrase for an epithet, as if I had 
intended  to say "a rapturously calm face" and I said in-instead "a face of rapturous calm" in 
order to get  an illegitimate and meaningless rhetorical effect. I meant nothing of the kind, 
nothing so tame  and poor and scanty in sense: I meant a face which was an expression or rather a 
living image of  the rapturous calm of the supreme and infinite consciousness, - it is indeed so 
that it can well  be "Infinity's centre". The face of the liberated Buddha as presented to us by 
Indian art is  such an expression or image of the calm of Nirvana and could, I think, be quite 
legitimately  described as a face of Nirvanic calm, and that would be an apt and live phrase and 
not an ugly  artifice or twist of rhetoric. It should be remembered that the calm of Nirvana or 
the calm of  the supreme Consciousness is to spiritual experience something self-existent, 
impersonal and  eternal and not dependent on the person - or the face - which manifests it. In 
these two  passages I take then the liberty to regard X's criticism as erroneous at its base and 
therefore  invalid and inadmissible. <br /><br /> Then there are the lines from the Songs of the Sea:</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> The rains of deluge flee, a storm-tossed shade, <br /> 
Over thy breast of gloom...<sup>2</sup> </i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
"Thy breast of gloom" is not used here as a mere rhetorical and meaning-less variation of  
"thy gloomy breast"; it might have been more easily taken as that if it had been a human breast,  
though even then, it could have been entirely defensible in a fitting context; but it is the  breast 
of the sea, an image for a vast expanse supporting and reflecting or subject to the moods  or movements 
of the air and the sky. It is intended, in describing the passage of the rains of  deluge over the breast 
of the sea, to present a picture of a</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
storm-tossed shade crossing a vast  gloom: it is the gloom that has to be stressed and made the 
predominant idea and the breast or  expanse is only its support and not the main thing: 
this could not have been suggested by merely  writing "thy gloomy breast". A prepositional 
phrase need not be merely an artificial twist  replacing an adjective; for instance, "a world of 
gloom and terror" means something more than  "a gloomy and terrible world", it brings forward the 
gloom and terror as the very nature and  constitution, the whole content of the world and not merely 
an attribute. So also if one wrote  "Him too wilt thou throw to thy sword of sharpness" or "cast into 
thy pits of horror", would  it merely mean "thy sharp sword" and "thy horrible pits" ? and would not the 
sharpness and the  horror rather indicate or represent formidable powers of which the sword is the instrument 
and  the pits the habitation or lair? That would be rhetoric but it would be a rhetoric not  meaningless 
but having in it meaning and power. Rhetoric is a word with which we can batter  something we do not like; 
but rhetoric of one kind or another has been always a great part of  the world's best literature; Demosthenes, 
Cicero, Bossuet and Burke are rhetoricians, but their  work ranks with the greatest prose styles that have 
been left to us. In poetry the accusation  of rhetoric might be brought against such lines as Keats'</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
To conclude, there is "the swords of sheen" in the translation of Bande Mataram.<sup>2</sup> 
That might be more open to the critic's stricture, for the expression can be used and perhaps  
has been used in verse as merely equivalent to "shining swords"; but for any one with an alert  
imagination it can mean in certain contexts something more than that, swords that emit brilliance  
and seem to be made of light. X says that to use this turn in any other than an adjectival sense  is 
unidiomatic, but he admits that there need be no objection provided that it creates a sense of  
beauty, but he finds no beauty in any of these passages. But the beauty can be perceived only if  
the other sense is seen, and even then we come back to the question of personal reaction; you and  
other readers may feel beauty where he finds none. I do not myself share his sensitive abhorrence  of this</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
prepositional phrase; it may be of course because there are coarser rhetorical threads in  my 
literary taste. I would not, for instance, shrink from a sentence like this in a sort of free  verse, 
"Where is thy wall of safety? Where is thy arm of strength? Whither has fled thy vanished  face of glory?" 
Rhetoric of course, but it has in it an element which can be attractive, and it  seems to me to 
bring in a more vivid note and mean more than "thy strong arm" or "thy glorious  face" or than 
"the strength of thy arm" and "the glory of thy face".<br /> <br />
I come next to the critic's trenchant 
attack on that passage in my symbolic vision of Night  and Dawn in which there is recorded the conscious 
adoration of Nature when it feels the passage  of the omniscient Goddess of eternal Light. Trenchant, 
but with what seems to me a false edge;  or else if it is a sword of Damascus that would cleave the 
strongest material mass of iron he  is using it to cut through subtle air, the air closes behind his 
passage and remains unsevered.  He finds here only poor and false poetry, unoriginal in imagery and 
void of true wording and  true vision, but that is again a matter of personal reaction and everyone 
has a right to his  own, you to yours as he to his. I was not seeking for originality but for truth 
and the  effective poetical expression of my vision. He finds no vision there, and that may be because  
I could not express myself with any power; but it may also be because of his temperamental failure  to 
feel and see what I felt and saw. I can only answer to the intellectual reasonings and judgments  which 
turned up in him when he tried to find the causes of his reaction. These seem to me to be  either 
fastidious and unsound or founded on a mistake of comprehension and therefore invalid or  else 
inapplicable to this kind of poetry. His main charge is that there is a violent and altogether  
illegitimate transference of epithet in the expression "the wide-winged hymn of a great priestly  
wind".<sup>1</sup> A transference of epithet is not necessarily illegitimate, especially if it  
expresses something that is true or necessary to convey a sound feeling and vision of things:  
for instance, if one writes in an Ovidian account of the <i>denouement</i> of a lovers' quarrel</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i> In spite of a reluctant sullen heart <br /> 
My willing feet were driven to thy door, </i></div>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> Savitri, p. 4.<br /><br /> page 794<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
it might be said that it was something in the mind that was willing and the ascription of an emotion  or 
state of mind to the feet is an illegitimate transfer of epithet; but the lines express a  conflict of the 
members, the mind reluctant, the body obeying the force of the desire that moves  it and the use of the epithet 
is therefore perfectly true and legitimate. But here no such defence  is necessary because there is no transfer 
of epithets. The critic thinks that I imagined the wind  as having a winged body and then took away the wings 
from its shoulders and clapped them on to  its voice or hymn which could have no body. But I did nothing of the 
kind; I am not bound to give  wings to the wind. In an occult vision the breath, sound, movement by which we 
physically know of  a wind is not its real being but only the physical manifestation of the wind-god or the 
spirit of  the air, as in the Veda the sacrificial fire is only a physical birth, temporary body or  
manifestation of the god of Fire, Agni. The gods of the Air and other godheads in the Indian  tradition 
have no wings, the Maruts or storm-gods ride through the skies in their galloping  chariots with their 
flashing golden lances, the beings of the middle world in the Ajanta frescoes  are seen moving through the air 
not with wings but with a gliding natural motion proper to  ethereal bodies. The epithet "wide-winged" then does 
not belong to the wind and is not transferred  from it, but is proper to the voice of the wind which takes the 
form of a conscious hymn of  aspiration and rises ascending from the bosom of the great priest, as might a 
great-winged bird  released into the sky and sinks and rises again, aspires and fails and aspires again 
on the  "altar hills". One can surely speak of a voice or a chant of aspiration rising on wide wings  and 
I do not see how this can be taxed as a false or unpoetic image. Then the critic objects  to the expression 
"altar hills" on the ground that this is superfluous as the imagination of  the reader can very well supply 
this detail for itself from what has already been said: I do  not think this is correct, a very alert reader 
might do so but most would not even think of it,  and yet the detail is an essential and central feature of 
the thing seen and to omit it would be  to leave a gap in the middle of the picture by dropping out something 
which is indispensable to  its totality. Finally he finds that the line about the high boughs praying in the 
revealing sky  does not help but attenuates, instead of more strongly etching the picture. I do not know why,  
unless he has failed to feel and to see. The picture is that of a conscious adoration offered by  Nature and in 
that each element is</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 795<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
conscious in its own way, the wind and its hymn, the hills,  the trees. The wind is the great priest of 
this sacrifice of worship, his voice rises in a  conscious hymn of aspiration, the hills offer themselves with 
the feeling of being an altar of  the worship, the trees lift their high boughs towards heaven as the worshippers, 
silent figures  of prayer, and the light of the sky into which their boughs rise reveals the Beyond towards which  
all aspires. At any rate this "picture" or rather this part of the vision is a complete rendering  of what I saw in 
the light of the inspiration and the experience that came to me. I might indeed  have elaborated more details, 
etched out at more length but that would have been superfluous and  unnecessary; or I might have indulged in an 
ampler description but this would have been  appropriate only if this part of the vision had been the whole. 
This last line <sup>1</sup> is an expression  of an experience which I often had whether in the mountains or on 
the plains of Gujarat or  looking from my window in Pondicherry not only in the dawn but at other times and I am 
unable to  find any feebleness either in the experience or in the words that express it. If the critic or  any 
reader does not feel or see what I so often felt and saw, that may be my fault, but that is  not sure, for you and 
others have felt very differently about it; it may be a mental or a  temperamental failure on their part and it will 
be then my or perhaps even the critic's or  reader's misfortune.<br /> <br /> 
I may refer here to X's disparaging 
characterisation of my epithets. He finds that their only  merit is that they are good prose epithets, not 
otiose but right words in their right place and  exactly descriptive but only descriptive without any suggestion 
of any poetic beauty or any  kind of magic. Are there then prose epithets and poetic epithets and is the poet 
debarred  from exact description using always the right word in the right place, the mot justed I  am under 
the impression that all poets, even the greatest, use as the bulk of their  adjectives words that have that 
merit, and the difference from prose is that a certain  turn in the use of them accompanied by the power of 
the rhythm in which they are carried  lifts all to the poetic level. Take one of the passages I have quoted 
rom Milton,<sup>2</sup></p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">

<p class="small_savitri_text">

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
here the epithets are the same that would be used in prose, the right word in the  right place, 
exact in statement, but all lies in the turn which makes them convey  a powerful and moving 
emotion and the rhythm which gives them an unlifting passion  and penetrating insistence. In 
more ordinary passages such as the beginning of  Paradise Lost the epithets "forbidden tree" and 
"mortal taste" are of the same  kind, but can we say that they are merely prose epithets, good 
descriptive  adjectives and have no other merit? If you take the lines about Nature's  worship in Savitri, 
I do not see how they can be described as prose epithets;  at any rate I would never have dreamt of using 
in prose unless I wanted to  write poetic prose such expressions as "wide-winged hymn" or "a great priestly wind"  
or "altar hills" or "revealing sky"; these epithets belong in their very nature  to poetry alone whatever may be 
their other value or want of value. He says  they are obvious and could have been supplied by any imaginative reader; 
well,  so are Milton's in the passages quoted and per-haps there too the very remarkable  imaginative 
reader whom X repeatedly brings in might have supplied them by his  own unfailing poetic verve. Whether 
they or any of them prick a hidden beauty  out of the picture is for each reader to feel or judge for 
himself; but perhaps  he is thinking of such things as Keats' "magic casements" and "foam of perilous  
seas" and "fairy lands forlorn", but I do not think even in Keats the bulk of the  epithets are of 
that unusual character.<br /><br />
I have said that his objections are sometimes inapplicable. I mean by this 
that they  might have some force with regard to another kind of poetry but not to a poem like  Savitri. 
He says, to start with, that if I had had a stronger imagination, I would  have written a very different 
poem and a much shorter one. Obviously, and to say it  is a truism; if I had had a different kind of 
imagination, whether stronger or weaker,  I would have written a different poem and perhaps one more 
to his taste; but it  would not have been Savitri. It would not have fulfilled the intention or had  
anything of the character, meaning, world-vision, description and expression of  spiritual experience 
which was my object in writing this poem. Its length is an  indispensable condition for carrying out 
its purpose and everywhere there is this  length, critics may say an "unconscionable</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 797<br /><br /> </p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
length" - I am quoting the Times'<sup>1</sup> reviewer's descrip-tion1 in his otherwise eulogistic 
criticism of The Life Divine -  in every part, in every passage, in almost every canto or section of 
a canto.  It has been planned not on the scale of Lycidas or Comus or some brief  narrative poem, but of 
the longer epical narrative, almost a minor, though a  very minor Ramayana, it aims not at a minimum but 
at an exhaustive exposition  of its world-vision or world-interpretation. One artistic method is to select a  
limited subject and even on that to say only what is indispensable, what is  centrally suggestive and leave 
the rest to the imagination or understanding of  the reader. Another method which I hold to be equally 
artistic or, if you like,  architectural is to give a large and even a vast, a complete interpretation,  
omitting nothing that is necessary, fundamental to the completeness: that is the  method I have chosen 
in Savitri. But X has understood nothing of the significance  or intention of the pas-sages he is criticising, 
least of all, their inner sense - that is not his fault, but is partly due to the lack of the context and 
partly to  his lack of equipment and you have there an unfair advantage over him which enables  you to 
understand and see the poetic intention. He sees only an outward form of  words and some kind of 
surface sense which is to him vacant and merely ornamental  or rhetorical or something pretentious 
without any true meaning or true vision in  it: inevitably he finds the whole thing false and empty, 
unjustifiably ambitious  and pompous without deep meaning or, as he expresses it, pseudo and phoney. His  
objection of longueur would be perfectly just if the description of the night and  the dawn had been 
simply of physical night and physical dawn; but here the physical  night and physical dawn are, as the 
title of the canto clearly suggests, a symbol,  although what may be called a real symbol of an inner 
reality and the main purpose  is to describe by suggestion the thing symbolised; here it is a relapse 
into  Inconscience broken by a slow and difficult return of consciousness followed by  a brief but 
splendid and prophetic outbreak of spiritual light leaving behind it  the "day" of ordinary human 
consciousness in which the prophecy has to be worked  out. The whole of Savitri is, according to the 
title of the poem, a legend that  is a symbol and this opening canto is, it may be said, a key beginning 
and announcement.  So understood there is nothing here otiose or unnecessary; all is needed to bring out  by 
suggestion some aspect of the thing symbolised and so start</p>

adequately the working  out of the significance of the whole poem. It will of course seem much too long 
to a  reader who does not understand what is written or, understanding, takes no interest in  the subject; 
but that is unavoidable.<br /> To illustrate the inapplicability of some of his judgments one might take his  
objection to repetition of the cognates "sombre Vast", "unsounded Void", "opaque Inane",  "vacant Vasts"<sup>1</sup> 
and his clinching condemnation of the inartistic inelegance of their  occurrence in the same place at the end 
of the line. I take leave to doubt his statement  that in each place his alert imaginative reader, still less 
any reader without that equipment,  could have supplied these descriptions and epithets from the context, but let 
that pass.  What was important for me was to keep constantly before the view of the reader, not  imaginative but 
attentive to seize the whole truth of the vision in its totality, the  ever-present sense of the Inconscience in 
which everything is occurring. It is the  frame as well as the background without which all the details would either 
fall apart  or stand out only as separate incidents. That necessity lasts until there is the full  outburst of the 
dawn and then it disappears; each phrase gives a feature of this  Inconscience proper to its place and context. 
It is the entrance of the "lonely splendour"  into an otherwise inconscient obstructing and unreceptive world that 
has to be brought out  and that cannot be done without the image of the "opaque Inane" of the Inconscience which  
is the scene and cause of the resistance. There is the same necessity for reminding the  reader that the 
"tread" of the Divine Mother was an intrusion on the vacancy of the  Inconscience and the herald of 
deliverance from it. The same reasoning applies to the other  passages. As for the occurrence of the phrases 
in the same place each in its line, that is  a rhythmic turn helpful, one might say necessary to bring out 
the intended effect, to  emphasise this reiteration and make it not only understood but felt. It is not the 
result  of negligence or an awkward and inartistic clumsiness, it is intentional and part of the  technique. 
The structure of the pentameter blank verse in Savitri is of its own kind and  different in plan from the blank 
verse that has come to be ordinarily used in English  poetry. It dispenses with enjambment or uses it very 
sparingly and only when a special  effect is intended; each line must be strong enough to stand by itself, 
while at the  same time it fits harmoniously into the sentence or paragraph like stone</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
<sup>1</sup> Pp. 2-4. <br /> <br />page 799<br /><br /> </p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
added to  stone; the sentence consists usually of one, two, three or four lines, more rarely  five or six 
or seven: a strong close for the line and a strong close for the sentence  are almost indispensable except 
when some kind of inconclusive cadence is desirable;  here must be no laxity or diffusiveness in the rhythm or 
in the metrical flow  anywhere, - there must be a flow but not a loose flux. This gives an added importance  
to what comes at the close of the line and this placing is used very often to give  emphasis and prominence 
to a key phrase or a key idea, especially those which have  to be often reiterated in the thought and vision 
of the poem so as to recall  attention to things that are universal or fundamental or otherwise of the first  
consequence - whether for the immediate subject or in the total plan. It is this  use that is served here by 
the reiteration at the end of the line.<br /> <br />
I have not anywhere in Savitri written anything for the sake 
of mere picturesqueness  or merely to produce a rhetorical effect; what I am trying to do everywhere in 
the  poem is to express exactly something seen, something felt or experienced; if, for  instance, 
I indulge in the wealth-burdened line or passage, it is not merely for  the pleasure of the indulgence, 
but because there is that burden, or at least what  I conceive to be that, in the vision or the experience. 
When the expression has been  found, I have to judge, not by the intellect or by any set poetical rule, but 
by an  intuitive feeling, whether it is entirely the right expression and, if it is not,  I have to change 
and go on changing until I have received the absolutely right  inspiration and the right transcription of it 
and must never be satisfied with any  à peu prés or imperfect transcription even if that makes good poetry of 
one kind or  another. This is what I have tried to do. The critic or reader will judge for  himself whether I 
have succeeded or failed; but if he has seen nothing and  understood nothing, it does not follow that his adverse 
judgment is sure to  be the right and true one, there is at least a chance that he may so conclude,  not because 
there is nothing to see and nothing to understand, only poor  pseudo-stuff or a rhetorical emptiness but because 
he was not equipped for  the vision or the understanding. Savitri is the record of a seeing, of an  experience 
which is not of the common kind and is often very far from what  the general human mind sees and experiences. 
You must not expect appreciation  or understanding from the general public or even from many at the first touch;  
as I have pointed out, there must be a new extension of consciousness</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
and aesthesis to appreciate a new kind of mystic poetry. Moreover if it is really  new in kind, it may employ a new 
technique, not perhaps absolutely new, but  new in some or many of its elements: in that case old rules 
and canons and  standards may be quite inapplicable; evidently, you cannot justly apply to the  poetry of 
Whitman the principles of technique which are proper to the old metrical  verse or the established laws of 
the old traditional poetry; so too when we deal  with a modernist poet. We have to see whether what is essential 
to poetry is there  and how far the new technique justifies itself by new beauty and perfection, and a  certain 
freedom of mind from old conventions is necessary if our judgment is to be  valid or rightly objective.<br /> <br /> 
Your friend may say as he has said in another connection that all this is only special  pleading or an apology 
rather than an apologia. But in that other connection he was  mistaken and would be so here too, for in neither 
case have I the feeling that I had  been guilty of some offence or some short-coming and therefore there could be 
no place  for an apology or special pleading such as is used to defend or cover up what one knows  to be a false case. 
I have enough respect for truth not to try to cover up an imperfection;  my endeavour would be rather to cure the 
recognised imperfection ; if I have not poetical  genius, at least I can claim a sufficient, if not an infinite 
capacity for painstaking:  that I have sufficiently shown by my long labour on Savitri. Or rather, since it 
was not  labour in the ordinary sense, not a labour of painstaking construction, I may describe it  as an 
infinite capacity for waiting and listening for the true inspiration and rejecting  all that fell short of it, 
however good it might seem from a lower standard until I got  that which I felt to be absolutely right. 
X was evidently under a misconception with  regard to my defence of the wealth-burdened line; he says that 
the principle enounced  by me was sound but what mattered was my application of the principle, and he 
seems to  think that I was trying to justify my application although I knew it to be bad and false  by 
citing passages from Milton and Shakespeare as if my use of the wealth-burdened style  were as good as theirs. 
But I was not defending the excellence of my practice, for the  poetical value of my lines was not then in 
question; the question was whether it did not  violate a valid law of a certain chaste economy by the use 
of too many epithets massed  together: against this I was asserting the legitimacy of a massed richness, 
I was defending  only its principle,</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 801<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
not my use of the principle. Even a very small poet can cite in aid of  his practice examples from 
greater poets without implying that his poetry is on a par with  theirs. But he further asserts 
that I showed small judgment in choosing my citations,  because Milton's passage<sup>1</sup> is 
not at all an illustration of the principle and  Shakespeare's<sup>2</sup> is inferior in poetic 
value, lax and rhetorical in its  richness and belongs to an early and inferior Shakespearean 
style. He says that  Milton's astounding effect is due only to the sound and not to the words. 
That does not  seem to me quite true: the sound, the rhythmic resonance, the rhythmic significance  
is undoubtedly the predominant factor; it makes us hear and feel the crash and clamour  and clangour 
of the downfall of the rebel angels: but that is not all, we do not merely  hear as if one were listening 
to the roar of ruin of a collapsing bomb-shattered house,  but saw nothing, we have the vision and the 
full psychological commotion of the "hideous"  and flaming ruin of the down-fall, and it is the 
tremendous force of the words that makes  us see as well as hear. X's disparagement of the Shakespearean 
passage on "sleep" and the  line on the sea considered by the greatest critics and not by myself only as 
ranking amongst  the most admired and admirable things in Shakespeare is surprising and it seems to me to  
illustrate a serious limitation in his poetic perception and temperamental sympathies.  Shakespeare's 
later terse and packed style with its more powerful dramatic effects can  surely be admired without 
disparaging the beauty and opulence of his earlier style; if  he had never written in that style, 
it would have been an unspeakable loss to the sum  of the world's aesthetic possessions. The lines 
I have quoted are neither lax nor  merely rhetorical, they have a terseness or at least a compact-ness 
of their own,  different in character from the lines, let us say, in the scene of Antony's death  or other 
memorable passages written in his great tragic style but none the less at  every step packed with pregnant 
meanings and powerful significances which would not  be possible if it were merely a loose rhetoric. Anyone 
writing such lines would

deserve to rank by them alone among the great and even the greatest poets...<br /> <br />
As regards your friend's appraisal of the mystical poems, I need say little. I accept  his reservation 
that there is much inequality as between the different poems: they were  produced very rapidly - 
in the course of a week, I think - and they were not given the  long reconsideration that I have usually 
given to my poetic work before publication; he  has chosen the best, though there are others also that are 
good, though not so good; in  others, the metre attempted and the idea and language have not been lifted to 
their  highest possible value. I would like to say a word about his hesitation over some  lines in 
<i>Thought the Paraclete<sup>1</sup></i> which describe the spiritual planes. I can understand  this 
hesitation; for these lines have not the vivid and forceful precision of the  opening and the close 
and are less pressed home, they are general in description  and therefore to one who has not the 
mystic experience may seem too large and vague.  But they are not padding; a precise and exact description 
of these planes of  experience would have made the poem too long, so only some large lines are given,  
but the description is true, the epithets hit the reality and even the colours  mentioned in the poem, 
"gold-red feet" and "crimson-white mooned oceans", are  faithful to experience. Significant colour, 
supposed by intellectual criticism to  be symbolic but there is more than that, is a frequent element 
in mystic vision; I  may mention the powerful and vivid vision in which Ramakrishna went up into the  
higher planes and saw the mystic truth behind the birth of Vivekananda. At least,  the fact that these 
poems have appealed so strongly to your friend's mind may perhaps  be taken by me as a sufficient proof 
that in this field my effort at interpretation of  spiritual things has not been altogether a failure.<br /> <br />
But how then are we to account for the same critic's condemnation or small  appreciation of Savitri which is 
also a mystic and symbolic poem al-though cast  into a different form and raised to a different pitch, and 
what value am I to  attach to his criticism ? Partly, perhaps, it is this very difference of form  and pitch 
which accounts for his attitude and, having regard to his aesthetic  temperament and its limitations, 
it was inevitable. He him-self seems to suggest  this reason when he compares this difference to the 
difference of his approach  as between Lycidas and Paradise Lost. His</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
temperamental turn is shown by his  special appreciation of Francis Thompson and Coventry Patmore and his 
response  to Descent and Flame-Wind and the fineness of his judgment when speaking of the  Hound of Heaven 
and the Kingdom of God, its limitation by his approach towards  Paradise Lost. I think he would be naturally 
inclined to regard any very high-pitched  poetry as rhetorical and unsound and declamatory, wherever he 
did not see in it  something finely and subtly true coexisting with the high-pitched expression,- the  
combination we find in Thompson's later poem and it is this he seems to have missed  in Savitri. For 
Savitri does contain or at least I intended it to contain what you  and others have felt in it but he has 
not been able to feel because it is something  which is outside his own experience and to which he has no access. 
One who has had  the kind of experience which Savitri sets out to express or who, not having it, is  prepared 
by his temperament, his mental turn, his previous intellectual knowledge  or psychic training, to have some kind 
of access to it, the feeling of it if not  the full understanding, can enter into the spirit and sense of the poem 
and  respond to its poetic appeal; but without that it is difficult for an unprepared  reader to respond, - 
all the more if this is, as you contend, a new poetry with a  new law of expression and technique.<br /> <br /> 

<i>Lycidas</i> is one of the finest poems in any literature, one of the most  consistently perfect among works of an equal 
length and one can apply to it the  epithet "exquisite" and it is to the exquisite that your friend's aesthetic  
temperament seems specially to respond. It would be possible to a reader with  a depreciatory turn to find flaws 
in it, such as the pseudo-pastoral setting,  the too powerful intrusion of St. Peter and puritan theological 
controversy into  that incongruous setting and the image of the hungry sheep which someone not in  sympathy 
with Christian feeling and traditional imagery might find even ludicrous  or at least odd in its identification 
of pseudo-pastoral sheep and theological  human sheep: but these would be hypercritical objections and are 
flooded out by the  magnificence of the poetry. I am prepared to admit the very patent defects of  Paradise Lost'. 
Milton's heaven is indeed unconvincing and can be described as  grotesque and so too is his gunpowder battle up 
there, and his God and angels  are weak and unconvincing figures, even Adam and Eve, our first parents, do not  
effectively fill their part except in his outward description of them; and the  later narrative falls far below 
the grandeur of the first four books but</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 804<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
those four books stand for ever among the greatest things in the world's poetic  literature. If Lycidas with 
its beauty and perfection had been the supreme thing  done by Milton even with all the lyrical poetry and the 
sonnets added to it, Milton  would still have been a great poet but he would not have ranked among the dozen  
greatest; it is Paradise Lost that gives him that place. There are deficiencies if  not failures in almost all 
the great epics, the Odyssey and perhaps the Divina  Commedia being the only exceptions, but still they are 
throughout in spite of them  great epics. So too is Paradise Lost. The grandeur of his verse and language is  
constant and unsinking to the end and makes the presentation always sublime. We  have to accept for the moment 
Milton's dry Puritan theology and his all too human  picture of the celestial world and its denizens and then we 
can feel the full  greatness of the epic. But the point is that this greatness in itself -seems to  have less 
appeal to X's aesthetic temperament; it is as if he felt less at home  in its atmosphere, in an atmosphere of 
grandeur and sublimity than in the air of  a less sublime but a fine and always perfect beauty. It is the difference 
between  a magic hill-side woodland of wonder and a great soaring mountain climbing into a  vast purple sky: to 
accept fully the greatness he needs to find in it a finer  and subtler strain as in Thompson's Kingdom of God. 
On a lower scale this,  his sentence about it seems to suggest, is the one fundamental reason for his  complete 
pleasure in the mystical poems and his very different approach to  Savitri. The pitch aimed at by Savitri, the 
greatness you attribute to it,  would of itself have discouraged in him any abandonment to admiration and  compelled 
from the beginning a cautious and dubious approach; that soon  turned to lack of appreciation or a lowered 
appreciation even of the best  that may be there and to depreciation and censure of the rest.<br /> <br /> 

But there is the other reason which is more effective. He sees and feels nothing of  the spiritual meaning and 
the spiritual appeal which you find in Savitri; it is for  him empty of anything but an outward significance 
and that seems to him poor, as is  natural since the outward meaning is only a part and a surface and the rest 
is to his  eyes invisible. If there had been what he hoped or might have hoped to find in  my poetry, a spiritual 
vision such as that of the Vedantin, arriving beyond the  world towards the In-effable, then he might have felt 
at home as he does with  Thompson's poetry or might at least have found it sufficiently accessible. 
But  this is not</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 805<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
what <i>Savitri</i> has to say or rather it is only a small part of it and,  even so, bound up with 
a cosmic vision and an acceptance of the world which in  its kind is unfamiliar to his mind and psychic 
sense and foreign to his experience.  The two passages with which he deals do not and cannot give any full 
presentation of  this way of seeing things since one is an unfamiliar symbol and the other an incidental  
and, taken by itself apart from its context, an isolated circumstance. But even if he  had had other more 
explicit and clearly revealing passages at his disposal, I do not  think he would have been satisfied or 
much illuminated; his eyes would still have been  fixed on the surface and caught only some intellectual 
meaning or outer sense. That at  least is what we may suppose to have been the cause of his failure, if we 
maintain that  there is anything at all in the poem; or else we must fall back on the explanation of a  
fundamental personal incompatibility and the rule de gustibus non est disputandum,  or to put it in the 
Sanskrit form nanarucirhi lokah. If you are right in maintaining  that Savitri stands as a new mystical 
poetry with a new vision and expression of things,  we should expect, at least at first, a widespread, 
perhaps, a general failure even in  lovers of poetry to understand it or appreciate; even those who have 
some mystical turn  or spiritual experience are likely to pass it by if it is a different turn from theirs  
or outside their range of experience. It took the world something like a hundred years to  discover Blake; 
it would not be improbable that there might be a greater time-lag here,  though naturally we hope for better 
things. For in India at least some understanding  or feeling and an audience few and fit may be possible. 
Perhaps by some miracle there  may be before long a larger appreciative audience.<br /> <br /> 

At any rate this is 
the only thing one can do, especially when one is attempting  a new creation, to go on with the work with 
such light and power as is given to  one and leave the value of the work to be determined by the future. 
Contemporary  judgments we know to be unreliable; there are only two judges whose joint verdict  
cannot easily be disputed, the World and Time. The Roman proverb says, securus  judicat orbis ten-arum; 
but the world's verdict is secure only when it is  confirmed by Time. For it is not the opinion of the 
general mass of men that  finally decides, the decision is really imposed by the judgment of a minority  
and elite which is finally accepted and settles down as the verdict of posterity;  in Tagore's phrase it 
is the universal man, <i>Viswa Manava</i>, or rather something</p>

<p class="small_savitri_text">
page 806<br /><br /> </p>
<hr />

<p class="savitri_text_justified"><br />
universal using the general mind of man, we might say the Cosmic Self in the  race that fixes the value of its 
own works. In regard to the great names in  literature this final verdict seems to have in it something of 
the absolute, -  so far as anything can be that in a temporal world of relativities in which the  Absolute 
reserves itself hidden behind the veil of human ignorance. It is no use  for some to contend that Virgil 
is a tame and elegant writer of a wearisome work  in verse on agriculture and a tedious pseudo-epic written 
to imperial order and  Lucretius the only really great poet in Latin literature or to depreciate Milton  
for his Latin English and inflated style and the largely uninteresting character  of his two epics; 
the world either refuses to listen or there is a temporary  effect, a brief fashion in literary criticism, 
but finally the world returns to  its established verdict. Lesser reputations may fluctuate, but finally 
whatever  has real value in its own kind settles itself and finds its just place in the  durable judgment 
of the world. Work which was neglected and left aside like  Blake's or at first admired with reservation 
and eclipsed like Donne's is  singled out by a sudden glance of Time and its greatness recognised; or what  
seemed buried slowly emerges or re-emerges; all finally settles into its place.  What was held as sovereign 
in its own time is rudely dethroned but afterwards  recovers not its sovereign throne but its due position in 
the world's esteem;  Pope is an example and Byron who at once burst into a supreme glory and was the  one 
English poet, after Shakes-peare, admired all over Europe but is now  depreciated, may also recover his proper 
place. Encouraged by such examples,  let us hope that these violently adverse judgments may not be final and  
absolute and decide that the waste paper basket is not the proper place for  Savitri. There may still be a 
place for a poetry which seeks to enlarge the  field of poetic creation and find for the inner spiritual 
life of man and  his now occult or mystical knowledge and experience of the whole hidden  range of his and 
the world's being, not a corner and a limited expression  such as it had in the past, but a wide space and 
as manifold and integral  an expression of the boundless and innumerable riches that lie hidden and  unexplored as 
if kept apart under the direct gaze of the Infinite as has been  found in the past for man's surface and finite 
view and experience of himself  and the material world in which he has lived striving to know himself and it  as 
best he can with a limited mind and senses. The door that has been shut to  all but a few may open; the 
kingdom of the Spirit</p>

may be established not only  in man's inner being but in his life and his works. Poetry also may have its  
share in that revolution and become part of the spiritual empire.<br /> <br /> 
I had intended as the main subject 
of this letter to say something about technique  and the inner working of the intuitive method by which Savitri 
was and is being  created and of the intention and plan of the poem. X's idea of its way of creation,  
an intellectual construction by a deliberate choice of words and imagery, badly  chosen at that, is the 
very opposite of the real way in which it was done. That  was to be the body of the letter and the rest only 
a preface. But the preface  has become so long that it has crowded out the body. I shall have to postpone  
it to a later occasion when I have more time.</p>
