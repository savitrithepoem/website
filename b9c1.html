Her high nude soul, <br /> Stripped of the girdle of mortality, <br /> Against fixed destiny and the grooves of law <br /> Stood up in its sheer will a primal force. <br /> Still like a statue on its pedestal, <br /> Lone in the silence and to vastness bared, <br /> Against midnight's dumb abysses piled in front <br /> A columned shaft of fire and light she rose. <br /></td>
