<td class="td_poem_text" colspan="3"><br /> Overleaping the fixed hurdles set by Time, <br /> The rapid net of an intuitive clasp <br /> Captures the fugitive happiness we desire. <br /> A Nature lifted by a larger breath, <br /> Plastic and passive to the all-shaping Fire, <br /> Answers the flaming Godhead's casual touch: <br /> Immune from our inertia of response <br /> It hears the word to which our hearts are deaf, <br /> Adopts the seeing of immortal eyes <br /> And, traveller on the roads of line and hue, <br /> Pursues the spirit of beauty to its home. <br /> Thus we draw near to the All-Wonderful <br /> Following his rapture in things as sign and guide; <br /> Beauty is his footprint showing us where he has passed, <br /> Love is his heart-beats' rhythm in mortal breasts, <br /> Happiness the smile on his adorable face. <br /> A communion of spiritual entities, <br /> A genius of creative Immanence, <br /> Makes all creation deeply intimate: <br /> A fourth dimension of aesthetic sense <br /> Where all is in ourselves, ourselves in all, <br /> To the cosmic wideness re-aligns our souls. <br /> A kindling rapture joins the seer and seen; <br /> The craftsman and the craft grown inly one <br /> Achieve perfection by the magic throb <br /> And passion of their close identity. <br /> All that we slowly piece from gathered parts, <br /> Or by long labour stumblingly evolve, <br /> Is there self-born by its eternal right. <br /> In us too the intuitive Fire can burn; <br /> An agent Light, it is coiled in our folded hearts, <br /> On the celestial levels is its home: <br /> Descending, it can bring those heavens here. <br /> But rarely burns the flame nor burns for long; <br /> The joy it calls from those diviner heights <br /> Brings brief magnificent reminiscences <br /></td>
