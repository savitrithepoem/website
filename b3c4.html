Eternity <br /> Cast down its incommunicable lids <br /> Over its solitudes remote from ken <br /> Behind the voiceless mystery of sleep. <br /> The grandiose respite failed, the wide release. <br /> Across the light of fast-receding planes <br /> That fled from him as from a falling star, <br /> Compelled to fill its human house in Time <br /> His soul drew back into the speed and noise <br /> Of the vast business of created things. <br /> A chariot of the marvels of the heavens <br /> Broad-based to bear the gods on fiery wheels, <br /> Flaming he swept through the spiritual gates. <br /> The mortal stir received him in its midst. <br /> Once more he moved amid material scenes, <br /> Lifted by intimations from the heights <br /> And in the pauses of the building brain <br /> Touched by the thoughts that skim the fathomless surge <br /> Of Nature and wing back to hidden shores. <br /> The eternal seeker in the aeonic field <br /> Besieged by the intolerant press of hours <br /> Again was strong for great swift-footed deeds. <br /></td>
