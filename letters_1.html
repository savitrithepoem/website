There is a previous draft, the result of the many  retouchings of which somebody told you; 
but in that form it would not have been  a "<i>magnum opus</i>" at all. Besides, it would have been 
a legend and not a symbol. I  therefore started recasting the whole thing; only the best passages 
and lines of  the old draft will remain, altered so as to fit into the new frame.<br /> No, I do 
not work at the poem once a week; I have other  things to do. Once a month perhaps, I look at the 
new form of the first book and make such  changes as inspiration points out to me - so that nothing 
shall fall below the minimum  height which I have fixed for it.</p>

<i>Savitri</i> is blank verse without enjambment (except  rarely) - each line a thing by itself and 
arranged in paragraphs of one, two,  three, four, five lines (rarely a longer series), in an attempt 
to catch  something of the Upanishadic and Kalidasian movement, so far as that is a  possibility in 
English. You can't take that as a model - it is too difficult a  rhythm-structure to be a model. I 
shall myself know whether it is a success or  not, only when I have finished two or three books. But 
where is the time now for  such a work? When the supramental has finished coming down, then perhaps.

Don't make prophecies. How do you know that Savitri is or is going to be  supramental poetry? It 
is not, in fact - it is only an attempt to render  into poetry a symbol of things occult and spiritual.

even if it brings no immediate satisfaction to you.

What you write about your inspiration is very interesting. There is no  invariable how - except that 
I receive from above my head and receive  changes and corrections from above without any initiation by 
myself or  labour of the brain. Even if I change a hundred times, the mind does not  work at that, it 
only receives. Formerly it used not to be so, the mind was  always labouring at the stuff of an 
unshaped formation... . The poems come  as a stream beginning at the first line and ending at the 
last-only some  remain with one or two changes, others have to be recast if the first  inspiration 
was an inferior one. Savitri is a work by itself unlike all the  others. I made some eight or ten 
recasts of it originally under the old  insufficient inspiration. Afterwards I am altogether rewriting 
it,  concentrating on the first book and working on it over and over again with  the hope that every 
line may be of a perfect perfection - but I have hardly  any time now for such work.

That is very simple<sup>1</sup>. I used Savitri as a means of ascension. I began with it  on a 
certain mental level, each time I could reach a higher level I rewrote  from that level. Moreover 
I was particular - if part seemed to me to come  from any lower levels I was not satisfied to leave 
it because it was good  poetry. All had to be as far as possible of the same mint. In fact Savitri  
has not been regarded by me as a poem to be written and finished, but as a  field of experimentation 
to see how far poetry could be written from one's  own yogic consciousness and how that could be made 
creative. I did not  rewrite Rose of God or the sonnets except for two or three verbal  alterations 
made at the moment.

<sup>1</sup> The question was: "We have been wondering why you should have to write and  rewrite you 
poetry --- for instance, Savitri ten or twelve times --- when  you have all the inspiration at your 
command and do not have to receive it with the  difficulty that faces budding Yogis like us."<br /><br /> page 728<br /><br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
<i>Savitri</i> was originally written many years ago before the Mother came, as a narrative poem in 
two  parts. Part I Earth and Part II Beyond (these two parts are still extant in  the scheme<sup>1</sup>) 
each of four books - or rather Part II consisted of three books  and an epilogue. Twelve books to an 
epic is a classical superstition, but  the new Savitri may extend to ten books - if much is added in 
the final  version it may be even twelve<sup>2</sup>. The first book has been lengthening and  
lengthening out till it must be over 2000 lines, but I shall break up the  original first four into 
five, I think - in fact I have already started  doing so. These first five will be, as I conceive 
them now, the Book of  Birth, the Book of Quest, the Book of Love, the Book of Fate, the Book of  
Death. As for the second Part, I have not touched it yet. There was no  climbing of planes there in 
the first version - rather Savitri moved through  the worlds of Night, of Twilight, of Day - all of 
course in a spiritual  sense - and ended by calling down the power of the Highest Worlds of 
Sachchidananda.  I had no idea of what the supramental World could be like at  that time, so it 
could not enter into the scheme. As for expressing the  supramental inspiration, that is a matter of 
the future.</p>

Savitri is represented in the poem as an incarnation of the Divine Mother...  This incarnation is 
supposed to have taken place in far past times when  the whole thing had to be opened, so as to 
"hew the ways of Immortality".

The poem was originally written from a lower level, a mixture perhaps of the  inner mind, psychic, 
poetic intelligence, sublimised vital, afterwards with  the Higher Mind, often illumined and 
intuitivised, intervening. Most of the  stuff of the first book is new or else the old so altered as to 
be no more  what it was; the best of the old has sometimes been kept almost intact  because it had

the higher inspiration. Moreover, there have been made several successive revisions  each trying to 
lift the general level higher and higher towards a possible  Overmind poetry. As it now stands there 
is a general Overmind influence, I  believe, sometimes coming fully through, sometimes colouring the 
poetry of  the other higher planes fused together, sometimes lifting any one of these  higher planes 
to its highest or the psychic, poetic intelligence or vital  towards them.

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
I don't think about the technique because thinking is no longer in my line.  But I see and feel for it 
when the lines are coming through and afterwards  in revision of the work. I don't bother about details 
while writing, because  that would only hamper the inspiration. I let It come through without  
interference; only pausing if there is an obvious inadequacy felt, in which  case I conclude that 
it is a wrong inspiration or inferior level that has  cut across the communication. If the inspiration 
is the right one, then I  have not to bother about the technique then or afterwards, for there comes  
through the perfect line with the perfect rhythm inextricably intertwined or  rather fused into an 
inseparable and single unity; if there is anything  wrong with the expression that carries with it an 
imperfection in the  rhythm, if there is a flaw in the rhythm, the expression also does not carry  
its full weight, is not absolutely inevitable. If on the other hand the  inspiration is not throughout 
the right one, then there is an after  examination and recasting of part or whole. The things I lay 
most stress on  then are whether each line in itself is the inevitable thing not only as a  whole but 
in each word; whether there is the right distribution of sentence  lengths (an immensely important 
thing in this kind of blank verse); whether  the lines are in their right place, for all the lines 
may be perfect, but  they may not combine perfectly together - bridges may be needed, alterations  
of position so as to create the right development and perspective etc., etc.  Pauses hardly exist 
in this kind of blank verse; variations of rhythm as  between the lines, of caesura, of the 
distribution of long and short,  clipped and open syllables, manifold constructions of vowel 
and consonant  sounds, alliteration, assonances, etc., distribution into one line, two  line, 
three or four or five line, many line sentences, care to make each  line tell by itself in its own 
mass and force and at the same time form  harmonious whole sentence - <br />

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
these are the  important things. But all that is usually taken care of by the inspiration  itself, 
for as I know and have the habit of the technique, the inspiration  provides what I want according to 
standing orders. If there is a defect I  appeal to headquarters, till a proper version comes along or 
the defect is  removed by a word or phrase substitute that flashes - with the necessary  sound and 
sense. These things are not done by thinking or seeking for the  right thing - 
the two agents are sight and call. Also feeling - the solar  plexus has to be 
satisfied and, until it is, revision after revision has to  continue. I may add 
that the technique does not go by any set mental rule  for the object is not 
perfect technical elegance according to precept but  sound - significance filling 
out the word - significance. If that can be  done by breaking rules, well, so 
much the worse for the rule.

I can never be certain of newly written stuff (I mean in this Savitri) until  I 
have looked at it again after an interval. Apart from the quality of new  lines, 
there is the combination with others in the whole which I have  modified more 
than anything else in my past revisions.

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
Allow me to point out that whatever I did in a jiffy would not be any more  than 
provisionally final. It is not a question of making a few changes in  individual 
lines, that is a very minor problem; the real finality only comes  when all is 
felt as a perfect whole, no line jarring with or falling away  from the level of 
the whole though some may rise above it and also all the  parts in their proper
place making the right harmony. It is an inner feeling  that has to decide 
that... . Unfortunately the mind can't arrange these  things, one has to wait 
till the absolutely right thing comes in a sort of  receptive self-opening and 
calling-down condition. Hence the months.

I have done an enormous amount of work with Savitri. The third section has  been 
recast - not rewritten - so as to give it a more consistent epic swing  and 
amplitude and elevation of level. The

fourth section, the  Worlds, is undergoing transformation. The "Life"; part is in 
a way finished,  though I shall have to go over the ground perhaps some five or 
six times  more to ensure perfection of detail. I am now starting a recasting of 
the  "Mind" part of which I had only made a sort of basic rough draft. I hope  
that this time the work will stand as more final and definitive.

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
I have been kept too occupied with other things to make much headway with  the 
poem - except that I have spoiled your beautiful neat copy of the  "Worlds" under 
the oestrus of the restless urge for more and more  perfection; but we are here 
for World - improvement, so I hope that is  excusable.
</p>
<div class="right_aligned_date">1938</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
I have not been able to make any headway with <i>Savitri</i> - owing to lack of  
time and also to an appalled perception of the disgraceful imperfection of  all 
the sections after the first two. But I have tackled them again as I  think I 
wrote to you and have pulled up the third section to a higher  consistency of 
level; the "Worlds" have fallen into a state of manuscript  chaos, corrections 
upon corrections, additions upon additions,  rearrangements on rearrangements 
out of which perhaps some cosmic beauty  will emerge!</p>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
You will see when you get the full typescript [of the first three books)  that 
Savitri has grown to an enormous length so that it is no longer quite  the same 
thing as the poem you saw then. There are now three books in the  first part. 
The first, the Book of Beginnings, comprises five cantos which  cover the same 
ground as what you typed but contains also much more that is  new. The small 
passage about Aswapati and the other worlds has been replaced  by a new book, 
the Book of the Traveller of the Worlds, in fourteen cantos  with many thousand 
lines. There is also a third sufficiently long book, the  Book of the Divine 
Mother. In the new plan of the poem there is a second  part consisting of five 
books: two of these, the Book of Birth and Quest and  the Book of Love, have 
been

completed and another,  the Book of Fate, is almost complete. Two others, the 
Book of Yoga and the  Book of Death, have still to be written, though a part 
needs only a thorough  recasting. Finally, there is the third part consisting 
of four books, the  Book of Eternal Night, the Book of the Dual Twilight, the 
Book of  Everlasting Day and the Return to Earth, which have to be entirely 
recast  and the third of them largely rewritten. So it will be a long time 
before  <i>Savitri</i> is complete.<br /> In the new form it will be a sort of  
poetic philosophy of the Spirit and of  Life much profounder in its substance 
and vaster in its scope than was  intended in the original poem. I am trying of 
course to keep it at a very  high level of inspiration, but in so large a plan 
covering most subjects of  philosophical thought and vision and many aspects of 
spiritual experience  there is bound to be much variation of tone: but that is, 
I think, necessary  for the richness and completeness of the treatment.

I am not at all times impervious to criticism; I have accepted some of yours  
and changed my lines accordingly; I have also though not often accepted some  
adverse criticisms from outside and remoulded a line or a passage from the  
[poem] here and there. But your criticisms are based upon an understanding  
appreciation of the poem, its aim, meaning, method, the turn and quality of  
its language and verse technique. In your friend's judgments I find an  entire 
absence of any such understanding and accordingly I find his  criticisms to be 
irrelevant and invalid. What one does not understand or  perceive its meaning 
and spirit, one cannot fruitfully criticise.
