<td class="td_poem_text" colspan="3"><br /> Now it was here in this great golden dawn. <br /> By her still sleeping husband lain she gazed <br /> Into her past as one about to die <br /> Looks back upon the sunlit fields of life <br /> Where he too ran and sported with the rest, <br /> Lifting his head above the huge dark stream <br /> Into whose depths he must for ever plunge. <br /> All she had been and done she lived again. <br /> The whole year in a swift and eddying race <br /> Of memories swept through her and fled away <br /> Into the irrecoverable past. <br /> Then silently she rose and, service done, <br /> Bowed down to the great goddess simply carved <br /> By Satyavan upon a forest stone. <br /> What prayer she breathed her soul and Durga knew. <br /> Perhaps she felt in the dim forest huge <br /> The infinite Mother watching over her child, <br /> Perhaps the shrouded Voice spoke some still word. <br /> At last she came to the pale mother queen. <br /> She spoke but with guarded lips and tranquil face <br /> Lest some stray word or some betraying look <br /> Should let pass into the mother's unknowing breast, <br /> Slaying all happiness and need to live, <br /> A dire foreknowledge of the grief to come. <br /> Only the needed utterance passage found: <br /> All else she pressed back into her anguished heart <br /> And forced upon her speech an outward peace.<br /> <br /> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">* The Book of Death was taken from Canto Three of an early version of Savitri which had only six cantos and an epilogue. It was slightly revised at a late stage and a number of new lines were added, but it was never fully worked into the final version of the poem. Its original designation, "Canto Three", has been retained as a reminder of this.</span> <br /></td>

Deeply she listened, but to hear <br /> The voice that soon would cease from tender words <br /> And treasure its sweet cadences beloved <br /> For lonely memory when none by her walked <br /> And the beloved voice could speak no more. <br /> But little dwelt her mind upon their sense; <br /> Of death, not life she thought or life's lone end. <br /> Love in her bosom hurt with the jagged edges <br /> Of anguish moaned at every step with pain <br /> Crying, "Now, now perhaps his voice will cease <br /> For ever." Even by some vague touch oppressed <br /> Sometimes her eyes looked round as if their orbs <br /> Might see the dim and dreadful god's approach. <br /> But Satyavan had paused. He meant to finish <br /> His labour here that happy, linked, uncaring <br /> They two might wander free in the green deep <br /> Primaeval mystery of the forest's heart. <br /> A tree that raised its tranquil head to heaven <br /> Luxuriating in verdure, summoning <br /> The breeze with amorous wideness of its boughs, <br /> He chose and with his steel assailed the arm <br /> Brown, rough and strong hidden in its emerald dress. <br /> Wordless but near she watched, no turn to lose <br /> Of the bright face and body which she loved. <br /> Her life was now in seconds, not in hours, <br /> And every moment she economised <br /> Like a pale merchant leaned above his store, <br /> The miser of his poor remaining gold. <br /> But Satyavan wielded a joyous axe. <br /> He sang high snatches of a sage's chant <br /></td>

Now the great woodsman <br /> Hewed at him and his labour ceased: lifting <br /> His arm he flung away the poignant axe <br /> Far from him like an instrument of pain. <br /> She came to him in silent anguish and clasped, <br /> And he cried to her, "Savitri, a pang <br /> Cleaves through my head and breast as if the axe <br /> Were piercing it and not the living branch. <br /> Such agony rends me as the tree must feel <br /> When it is sundered and must lose its life. <br /> Awhile let me lay my head upon thy lap <br /> And guard me with thy hands from evil fate: <br /> Perhaps because thou touchest, death may pass." <br /> Then Savitri sat under branches wide, <br /> Cool, green against the sun, not the hurt tree <br /> Which his keen axe had cloven,--that she shunned; <br /> But leaned beneath a fortunate kingly trunk <br /> She guarded him in her bosom and strove to soothe <br /> His anguished brow and body with her hands. <br /> All grief and fear were dead within her now <br /> And a great calm had fallen.
