These letters are published at the end of Savitri for their rare value as a great poet's informal  
self-commentary. Apropos that value, a few facts of deep personal interest may be mentioned about  
the coming of this poem to its close.<br /><br /> Some months before his passing, Sri Aurobindo, 
as if in foreknowledge of the event, said: "I want  to finish Savitri soon." The words took by 
utter surprise the disciple, his scribe, who has been  used to the grandly patient way in which 
so far it had been composed and frequently retouched and  amplified. Even when, in the past, 
composition had been extraordinarily swift - once four to five  hundred lines needing hardly any 
change were dictated in succession - there had been no hurry in  the poet's attitude to his work. 
But now he increased immensely the general tempo of composition  and revision. There seemed a race 
with time. And it was almost towards the end that, after rapidly  revising the long second canto of 
the Book of Fate, he paused with some satisfaction. Then he  inquired what still remained to be 
written. On being told about the Book of Death and Epilogue  entitled The Return to Earth, which 
were yet to be caught up into a larger utterance, he remarked:  "Oh, that? We shall see about that 
afterwards." Savitri, as the footnote to the Book of Death  indicates, was not completed in the 
common meaning of the term and indeed Sri Aurobindo's  original plan was to give this part of the 
poem as well as the Epilogue a thorough recasting.  But his strange remark suggests that later, for 
reasons of his own, he was not anxious about  them and that what he had thought necessary had been 
done. So it is impossible to say definitely  that he did not wish Savitri to be, on the whole, just 
as he had left it after making corrections  and additions in the Canto already mentioned of the Book 
of Fate.<br /><br /> These corrections and additions were the last things he wrote in this epic of 
twenty-three thousand  [eight hundred and thirty seven (4th edition, 1993) lines, over which he 
spent so many years.  Among them, in view of subsequent circumstances, three newly written passages 
in the speech of  Narad stand out most significantly. The first is about the sacrifice the God-Man 
gives in history:<br />

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>He who has found his identity with God <br /> 
Pays with the body's death his soul's vast light. <br /> 
His knowledge immortal triumphs by his death.<br /></i>
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
The second dwells on the inner meaning with which Satyavan's departure from the earth is packed:<br />
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>
His death is a beginning of greater life... <br /> 
A vast intention has brought two souls close <br /> 
And love and death conspire towards one great end.<br /> 
For out of danger and pain heaven-bliss shall come, <br /> 
Time's unforeseen event, God's secret plan.</i>
<br /> 
</div>

<p class="savitri_text_justified">
The third is the passage of seventy-two lines, absolutely the last piece of poetry dictated by  
Sri Aurobindo, in which, with a sound as of massive repeating bells, Narad admonishes King  
Aswapathy's wife when she protests against the fate of loneliness that will be her daughter's  
Savitri's in consequence even as it appeared to be that of Sri Aurobindo's spiritual co-worker,  
the Mother, at the time the Master of the "Integral Yoga" withdrew from his body. Some lines may  
be quoted:<br />
</p>

<div class="left_margin_50_px">
<i>
As a star, uncompanioned, moves in heaven <br /> 
Travelling infinity by its own light, <br /> 
The great are strongest when they stand alone. <br /> 
A God-given might of being is their force, <br /> 
A ray from self's solitude of light the guide; <br /> 
The soul that can live alone with itself meets God; <br /> 
Its lonely universe is their rendezvous. <br /> 
A day may come when she must stand unhelped <br /> 
On a dangerous brink of the world's doom and hers, <br /> 
Carrying the world's future on her lonely breast, <br /> 
Carrying the human hope in a heart left sole <br /> 
To conquer or fail on a last desperate verge, <br /> 
Alone with death and close to extinction's edge. <br /> 
Must cross alone a perilous bridge in Time <br /> 
And reach an apex of world-destiny <br /> 
Where all is won or all is lost for man. <br /> 
In that tremendous silence lone and lost <br /> 
Of a deciding hour in the world's fate, <br /> 
In her soul's climbing beyond mortal time <br /> 
When she stands sole with Death or sole with God <br /> 
Apart upon a silent desperate brink, <br /> 
Alone with her self and death and destiny <br /> 
As on some verge between Time and Timelessness <br /> 
When being must end or life rebuild its base, <br /> 
Alone she must conquer or alone must fall. <br /> 
No human aid can reach her in that hour, <br /> 
No armoured god stand shining at her side. <br /> 
Cry not to heaven, for she alone can save. <br /> 
For this the silent Force came missioned down; <br /> 
In her the conscious Will took human shape: <br /> 
She only can save herself and save the world. <br /> 
O queen, stand back from that stupendous scene, <br /> 
Come not between her and her hour of Fate. <br /> 
Her hour must come and none can intervene: <br /> 
Think not to turn her from her heaven-sent task, <br /> 
Strive not to save her from her own high will. <br /> 
Thou hast no place in that tremendous strife; <br /> 
Thy love and longing are not arbiters there; <br /> 
Leave the world's fate and her to God's sole guard. <br /> 
Even if he seems to leave her to her lone strength, <br /> 
Even though all falters and falls and sees an end <br /> 
And the heart fails and only are death and night, <br /> 
God-given her strength can battle against doom <br /> 
Even on a brink where Death alone seems close <br /> 
And no human strength can hinder or can help. <br /> 
Think not to intercede with the hidden Will, <br /> 
Intrude not twixt her spirit and its force <br /> 
But leave her to her mighty self and Fate."
